{"G8xELw231qs": "Nick:\nI'm going to teach you everything you need to\nknow about steak. In this video, you'll learn how to cook the\nperfect steak as well as which steaks you should buy and more importantly, which\nsteaks not to buy. I'll also demonstrate the most popular\ncooking methods, including grilled, seared, reverse seared sous vide and broiled. I guarantee that if you watch this video,\nyou'll be a steak expert for life First. What makes a good steak? It all comes down to just one word: balance. And with steak, balance comes down to just\ntwo main things flavor and texture. You've probably heard the saying fat is\nflavor. Those little white fatty spots in meat are\ncalled marbling. When steak cooks, that fat melts into the\nmeat and keeps it tender and juicy while adding tons of great flavor. That's why it's so important to have that\nnice balance of fat. Those shots you just saw were Japanese a5\nWagyu, the nicest beef in the entire world. Different countries have their own grading\nsystems for marbling. The three main systems coming from the\nUnited States, Australia and Japan. These charts all rate based on the marbling,\nmeaning that the better the marbling, the more you'll probably pay. In front of me is\nevery single type of steak that comes from a cow before we cook. It is very important\nthat you understand which steaks come from, which portion of the cow, so that you'll be\nable to choose the right steak for you. You might already think you know which steaks\nyou like best, but what you're about to learn may completely change your mind. As I go through the steaks, I'm also going\nto add anywhere between 1 and $4 signs to show how expensive the steaks are here. I've broken down this cow into a few\ndifferent sections. You can get steak from the chuck rib loin\nflank and plate sections. Cuts that come from the round shank and brisket sections cannot\nbe cooked as a steak and typically have to be cooked low and slow. So even though I do love a good brisket, I\nwon't be discussing those today. Let's start with the Chuck section. From here we get the Chuck steak, which I\nlove because it comes from the first couple of cuts on the Chuck and is actually pretty\nsimilar to a ribeye steak but is much cheaper in price. The flatiron comes from the\nshoulder of the cow and is extremely tender with a good balance of marbling and an\nintense beefy flavor. Moving on to the rib section, we've got a\nribeye steak, which is my personal favorite. It has fantastic marbling and also contains\nthe cap, which is probably the best tasting meat in the entire cow. I'll demonstrate later in the video how to\ncook it and how to cut it. The loin section is a very tender part of\nthe cow, which makes for juicy but often very expensive steaks. You'll probably recognize\na lot of these. One of my favorites that comes from here is\nthe sirloin cap, popularly known as the Picanha. This is one of the most prized\nsteaks in all of Brazil, where it's often cooked over open flame. It's tender and juicy with a rich, beefy\nflavor and has a beautiful fat cap. The sirloin steak and the New York strip are\nboth less fatty than the ribeye with a great balance of tenderness and leanness. But I'd still choose a ribeye any day. The Porterhouse and T-Bone are both very\nsimilar in the sense that both steaks contain two cuts in one, both the filet and the\nstrip. The difference is the porterhouse has a\nlarger fillet and more fat content, which makes my personal preference the porterhouse\nover the T-Bone. Just be careful when cooking either of these\nsteaks because you're basically cooking two different steaks at the exact same time,\nwhich can make it hard to cook both perfectly. The filet mignon and the\ntenderloin both also come from the same section, but are highly overrated. Given how expensive these two cuts are, I\nwould suggest using your money to get something with more fat and therefore more\nflavor. Tri tip can also be tasty and typically has\ngreat marbling, but it's very tough and unforgiving if you overcook it. So I don't recommend this cut either. From the flank section comes the flank\nsteak, which is probably most recognizable as the beef that comes in your beef and\nbroccoli. If you order Chinese takeout, if you marinate\nit properly and cook it through to medium, it's delicious. Last but not least, we have\nthe short plate section. My favorite steak from here being the skirt\nsteak, specifically the outside skirt, which is more tender than the inside. Later in this video, we will cook and cut a\nskirt steak. And I really want to focus on the cutting\nportion of that because despite this being one of my favorite steaks out there, I was\ncutting it incorrectly most of my life. The final steak. And one of my other\npersonal favorites is the hanger steak. Let me tell you, if you haven't tried a\nhanger steak, you need to. It's also known as the butcher steak, since\nbutchers used to save this one for themselves. Trust me when I say you need to\ntry this one, you should use all of that information to find the best combination\nbetween flavor, cost and texture that works best for you. If you're still confused on\nwhat steaks to buy, ask your butcher or the person behind the meat counter at the\nsupermarket. I know they might look intimidating at\ntimes, but trust me when I say that they're gentle giants and they want to help you. Now that you know what steaks to buy,\nthere's just one last step before cooking. Seasoning. And the best part is it's very\nsimple. You'll just season with a high quality salt\nat least an hour before cooking your steak, if not overnight. This process is called dry\nbrining, and it's seasons. The whole steak, not just the very outside,\nwhich is what happens if you only salt right before cooking. Dry brining allows the salt\nto go into the meat so you get that flavor everywhere. You can also get creative with\nyour seasoning and use a marinade which works particularly well on steaks such as flank\nsteak and strip steak. I've seen tons of comments in the past\nasking me where my seasoning is if I've only used salt and pepper on a steak. But remember, there is nothing wrong with\nletting the flavor of steak speak for itself. Now that our steaks are seasoned, how do we\nknow which method to cook them with? There are plenty to choose from, but we'll do the best and most popular grilling,\nsearing, reverse, searing sous vide and broiling. And the best way to decide how to\ncook your steak comes down to one simple factor. Thickness. The focus here is cooking it evenly, all the\nway through to the center while still getting that nice crust on the outside. We're going to start with the most popular\nway to cook a steak, grilling. And as always, I'm looking for maximum\nflavor. So I'm going to start with the best charcoal\nyou can get anywhere in the world. This is called Binchotan Charcoal. I will warn you, it's probably going to be\nthe most expensive wood you ever buy, but it'll also probably be the best flavor you\never get. Once you've added this charcoal to our\nchimney starter, I'm going to go ahead and use my little trick of using Doritos as a\nfire starter because, believe it or not, Doritos light extremely well. I'll start by letting our Doritos on fire. And once they're going, I'll place my\ncharcoal on top. We'll let this go until our charcoal is\nfully on fire, at which point we want to let that die down to get these nice red, white,\nhot coals. It's hot enough now that I'm ready to pour\nthat charcoal into the grill and just look at that incredible glow that we've gotten since\nwe've already dry brined each of these steaks with salt. I'm going to go ahead and finish\nthem off now with some pepper you can save fresh cracked pepper for last minute just\nbefore you grill because this is probably too long for our grill. I'm also going to go\nahead and slice it in half. As you can see from the two steaks here, one\nis very thick and one is very thin. And as we talked about earlier, we're going\nto cook these in slightly different ways. With the skirt steak. It's extremely thin,\nso we'll want to sear it as quickly as possible. Once again, the goal here with\ncooking this thin steak is to cook it high and fast. We want to get that crust without\novercooking it. The ribeye will be a different story because\nthis charcoal is so hot, we're already ready to flip. I don't want to ruffle any\nfeathers, but to all the grill dads out there who are constantly touching and flipping\nyour steaks, just leave it. The only way you're going to get the proper\ncrust is if you let it sit there patiently on each side as long as you can. That right there is that perfect char that\nwe're looking for. I know you've probably heard a lot of people\ntalk about letting your steak rest, but in all seriousness, it's extremely important. I know you're probably tempted to dive right\nin, but you want those juices to stay sealed in the steak before you eat it. It's time to cook our ribeye. And as you can see, this is a much thicker\nsteak. And it's going to take a slightly different\ncooking method to get it done right. To begin, I'll start by rendering off that\nfat cap, which means we're going to start by cooking it with this thicker fat side down\nso that all that fat can get nice and crispy. The goal with this thicker steak here is\ngoing to be to get that nice crust and then move it off of the direct heat over here so\nthat it can continue staying warm and heat up the rest of the way through the center. If we kept it right over the charcoals\nthroughout the entire cooking process, we might actually burn the crust. And because it's a thicker steak, we need to\ngive it a little bit more time to cook all the way through and get that heat into the\ncenter. Now, once I've laid it down on the first\nside here, I'm going to leave it and let it sit until I feel that it's gotten the proper\ncrust. The reason we have a lot more flames with\nthis ribeye here is because there's so much more fat coming out of it. And all that fat, just like butter or oil is\ngoing to light on fire. I think it's already time to flip. Now that we've gotten a crust on both sides,\nI'm going to slide it over here to cook the rest of the way through. We've gotten a\nbeautiful char on this ribeye, which means tons and tons of flavor. Now that it's over indirect heat or not,\nright over the coals anymore, I'm going to cover it up so that all of that heat can go\nahead and cook it the rest of the way through, almost like a makeshift oven. While\nour ribeye finishes cooking. It's time to go ahead and cut one of our\nskirt steaks. When looking at it, at first glance, it might\nseem like you should cut it down the width, but the reason that's incorrect is because\nthat's cutting with the grain. And anytime we slice a steak, we want to cut\nagainst the grain. If you simply look at the direction that the\nfibers are going in, you can pretty easily tell that this grain goes along the width,\nwhich means we actually want to slice across the length of the steak. I'm going to cut it\nin half. So we have an easy piece to work with and\nthen begin slicing. This right here is perfectly cooked skirt\nsteak. And as you can see, because I've cut against\nthe grain, it's extremely soft and pull apart tender now that we've sliced all our skirt\nsteak, I have one last tip for you. Even though we let it rest for about ten\nminutes, we still have plenty of juices left on the board. And what I like to do is take\nall of my steak and drag it through all of those juices, and it's going to be\ndelicious. This here is a steak doneness chart that you\ncan use based on your own preferences and how you like your steak cooked with this steak\nhere, I'm using a thermometer that's measuring the internal temperature so I can\nknow when to pull it off the heat. And if you want it medium rare, you want to\ntake it off at about 130 Fahrenheit internal, which means we're a little behind. Always remember that there's going to be that\nresidual heat that continues cooking your steak even after you've taken it off the\ngrill. For example, this steak here is completely\noff the heat right now. But it's still very hot and will continue to\ncook through to the center as we let it rest. The ribeye has a few different sections, the\nmain two being the eye and the cap, The cap being one of the best tasting pieces of meat\nin the entire cow to carve it. I'm first going to remove the cap, which is\nalready somewhat separated but really is a separate piece from the eye. This piece here is typically mostly fat, so\nI can carve that off as well. With the skirt steak we talked about slicing\nagainst the grain, but the ribeye is already cut from the cow against the grain. We know that because we can see all the\nlittle muscle fibers sticking straight up here. This is great because it means there's\nno wrong way to cut a ribeye. If you're cooking ribeyes at a barbecue, the\nfat cap is what you should save for yourself. It is extremely juicy, extraordinarily\ntender, and the flavor just simply doesn't get better. And don't forget to always use\nall that juice. Oh, my God. Manny, take a bite. Manny: Oh, my God. So good. Nick:\nWhen it comes to searing, I actually\nsometimes prefer that method over grilling because I love the crust that you can get\nwhen searing a steak. But we can also add some incredible flavor\nhere through butter basting, which I'll show you shortly. For this method, we'll be using\na hanger steak. My preferred pan for searing a steak is a\ncast iron because it can get extremely hot and holds that heat very evenly. You'll want to begin by starting with some\noil that can get to a nice high smoke point. I like to add a little more oil in my pan\nthan most people do because I like that crust to get a little bit higher up on the steak. If you look carefully at any steak, there\nare quite a few crevices that will be in there and adding more oil is going to make\nsure that the oil goes up and inside those crevices and gets everything nice and\ncrispy. Once your oil is smoking hot, make sure you\ngo ahead and lay that steak away from you. Immediately, you're also going to want to\npress that steak down to make sure everything is touching the pan. If it bulges up, that's\nwhen you get these big, ugly gray spots and you're not going to get a good even crust. Once my steak is in, I'll slightly turn down\nthe heat so it doesn't burn. And once I've peeked on the underside of the\nsteak and it appears to have a nice crust, we'll go ahead and flip. That's a crust. Once that crust begins to form on the other\nside, this is when we can get some of that flavor I was talking about. Turn down your heat so the butter doesn't\nburn and add in a few cubes of butter. Then a few aromatics. Most commonly, people like to use garlic,\nsome rosemary and a little time. Once we've really made sure that all that\nbutter soaks up the flavor of those herbs and that garlic, I'm going to tilt that pan down\ntowards me to bring all the butter, but not the herbs over to this side. Then in a nice smooth motion, I'll start to\ncover my steak with butter over and over to give it all that flavor and cook it the rest\nof the way through. This is called butter basting. To rest my steak. I'm going to place it down\non my cutting board and use a little trick I learned from Gordon Ramsay himself. I'm going to take all my herbs and rest\nthose on top of the steak. And we also can't forget about that\ndelicious garlic. Then we can even pour over a little bit of\nthat oil and butter just to get those last bits of flavor. And that's how our steak\nwill rest. Once our steak has rested, we're going to\nslice into it. And once again, we want to make sure we're\nslicing against the grain, not with the grain. First, listen to this crust that we\njust got. What you're looking at here is why we rest\nour stakes. All that juice gets trapped inside. Whereas if we were to cut into it right\naway, that wouldn't happen. I got to feed my camera guy first. Manny: Can you take a bite? Nick:\nIs it good? Manny: That's amazing. Nick:\nIf you haven't tried hanger steak, go taste\nit. We'll move on to the reverse sear method. I'll be demonstrating this method with a\nporterhouse. And like I said, we have two different\nsteaks here, so I want to make sure we're getting them to the proper temperatures. These temperature probes will help us\nsimultaneously monitor both parts of the steak, given there are two different cuts. For a long time I'd heard of this term and\nhad absolutely no idea what it was. But it's actually very simple. Instead of trying to get the crust right\naway, we're going to put this on a cold pan into the oven and cook it until the internal\ntemperature reads about 125 or 130 Fahrenheit. It's time to take out our steak\nand finish it with a sear because as you can see, we need a nice crust. I want you to understand that this steak\nright here is already cooked perfectly, similar to sous vide, which we'll do\nshortly. It just doesn't yet have a crust and we want\na bit of a higher internal temperature. We'll go into our pan with a bit of high\nheat oil. And because this has a fat cap just like\nthat ribeye that we grilled, we're going to go ahead and start fat side. Now, if you don't render off the fat like\nthis, it's basically inedible. But if you cook it to a nice golden brown\nlike this, it's delicious. Once we've rendered off that fat cap, we can\nlay down our steak once again laying away from us so we don't get hit with oil. Once we've gotten a nice crust, it's time to\nflip. One reason lots of people like to reverse\nsear is they believe that by putting the steak in the oven, it really dries it out\nand gives you a nicer crust. The same thing that happens when you dry\nbrown your steak. Once you've gotten a crust on both sides,\nour steak is done. And after letting it take a nice nap, I'll\nplace it back on my cutting board and it's time to slice. I'll start by slicing the\nfilet right off the bone and it should cleanly come right out. Then I'll cut down the other side of the\nbone to get the strip. And I can already tell we've cooked this\nsteak perfectly. And now we get a nice taste of filet mignon. I know I said it's overrated, but I didn't\nsay it wasn't good. And a delicious New York strip. Nailed it. Once you've cooked one of these steaks, you\ncan certainly see why it's called a T-Bone. Moving on to one of my favorite methods to\ncook a steak. We'll be doing this picanha sous vide. I'll lay it fat side down and then begin\nslicing this into nice, thick steaks. You might notice that right now we're\nslicing with the grain instead of against the grain. And that's because once we cook this\nlater as a steak, we'll be able to slice it against the grain before we eat it. With Picanha, we want to focus on the flavor,\nso we're only going to hit it with a touch of salt. Sous vide is when you vacuum, seal\nyour food in a bag and then cook it in a precisely regulated water bath. The steak is cooked in its own juices and\nshould come out extremely tender. You'll probably want to get a nice vacuum\nsealer like this one because the goal is to make sure you get all the air out of that\nbag and get a nice tight seal. And it's a satisfying and extremely easy\nprocess. This is a circulator that's going to keep\nour water at the same temperature the entire time our steak cooks. Some people could call\nit lazy, but the reality is it's going to cook the steak to the perfect, perfect\ntemperature every single time. The only thing we don't get from sous vide\nis that nice crust on the outside of our steak. So we're going to set the temperature\na little bit below what we want it to end up at so that when our steak has reached that\ninternal temperature that we want, we can sear it off, which will bring it up a few\ndegrees, get us that nice crust and get us to the perfect temperature that we're looking\nfor. As you'll notice, the steak is pretty floppy\nand mushy and doesn't really have much color to it. But remember, this steak is cooked to\na perfect medium rare right now. You could eat it and be totally fine. It just lacks any texture. And that's why we need to get that crust\nbecause there's so much fat on my picanha I'm going to start by just rendering off that\nfat on the top. We might actually get enough oil out of this\nthing to sear the rest of the steak without even having to add anything. As I cook this, I'm going to move it around\nthe pan, pressing on all corners and sides to really melt down all that fat. Once our fat cap looks like this, it's time\nto see our steak. If your picanha doesn't look like this,\nyou're doing it wrong. The  Picanha had some time to rest and as\nyou can see, the grain runs along the length, so we'll be cutting across the width. I am very excited to dive into this steak. What's amazing about a bite like this is\nthat it's got beautiful marbling in the center. That nice little piece of rendered\noff fat cap on the top and a beautiful crust on the outside. There's a reason this is one\nof my favorite steaks in the entire world. The final method we'll test today is\nbroiling. And for that, we're going to be using this\nChuck steak. Buying a chuck steak is going to get you\nsomething very similar to a ribeye without that steep cost. I've talked today about making a simple\nmarinade for your steak and we're going to make one now. I'll add some lemon zest,\nlemon juice, a few cloves of garlic, a few Calabrian chilies, some rosemary and olive\noil. Once we've blended it up, I'll finish it\nwith just a touch of salt and a bit of black pepper. Ideally, we would have marinated\nthis steak overnight, but since we didn't get to do it ahead of time, I have another great\ntrick for you. I'll place my steak into this food saver\ncontainer, then pour over that marinade fully covering the steak with all this\ndeliciousness. Then I'll add back on this lid, make sure\nit's nice and tightly sealed. And using this machine we used earlier, I'm\ngoing to go ahead and marinate. And what we're doing here now is called\nrapid infusion. What we're doing is sucking out all of that\nair and speeding up the marination process by forcing that flavor into our steak. I'll let this sit for about 15 minutes to\nlet all that flavor do its thing, and then we're ready to broil. At this point, our\nflavors should be pretty infused, so I'm going to release the pressure and open it\nup. The smell of this marinade is unbelievable. Now that all that flavor has soaked deep\ninto our steak, we'll go ahead and transfer. For to a sheet tray where we're going to\nbroil it before you broil position that oven rack to one of the upper levels. And once you've set your oven to about as\nhigh as it can go and goes your steak. Once we can see that our steak has gotten a\nnice crust on the top and is beginning to sizzle, I'm going to go ahead and pull my\ntray out, give it a nice flip and back in we go after we've cooked about five minutes on\neither side, our steak should be done, so it's time to let it take a little nap. This one turns out extremely tender after\ncooking, but certainly looks a bit messier. So you can use your best judgment when it\ncomes time to slice the steak. Might be the most tender we've had today,\nand it's definitely nice and juicy. The fun thing also about using a marinade,\nit can make it taste however you like. I'm hoping that after watching this video,\nyou'll be a true master when it comes to I love steak."}
{"EYXQmbZNhy8": "- Today, I'm teaching you how to make the only vanilla cake\nrecipe you'll ever need. And if you like this video, don't forget to hit that\nLike button and subscribe. Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. This cake will be ready\nbefore you know it, so let's get started. First off, set your oven to 350 and prep your two eight-inch pans. You could also make this with three six-inch pans if you want. Going to give the sides\na nice bit of butter, a little for the bottom, and then just place\nthat sheet right there. A circle of parchment\npaper is your insurance for no broken or cracked\ncakes when they release; that is heartbreak. For this cake, we're using 2 1/2 cups or 280 grams of all-purpose flour. This cake will be the best if you measure your flour the right way, which is with a scale. If you're not using a\nscale, fluff the flour up and then sprinkle it\ninto your measuring cup. Now we're adding 3/4 of a teaspoon of salt and 2 1/4 teaspoons of baking powder. Now we're going to sift\nit up and whisk it out. (chuckles) Now we're going to sift\nit out and whisk it up. Set it aside. All right, let's get that stand mixer. For this cake, we're using 3/4 of a cup or 170 grams of room\ntemperature unsalted butter. And room temperature means\nyou can press into the butter, and it'll yield to the touch. We're going to cream the butter up so it is nice and smooth\nbefore we add the sugar. And while we cream it up, we can crack three eggs into a small bowl. You do not want any shells in\nyour delicious vanilla cake. (upbeat music) Our butter is nice and creamed up. You can always scrape the\nbowl down a little bit before you add another ingredient in. We want a homogenous mixture. Now we're going to add 1 2/3\ncups of granulated sugar; that's 333 grams. Add it in while it's mixing. Increase to high and\nget it nice and fluffy. Mix for three minutes. It looks fluffy on top, but not so much on the bottom, so we're going to scrape it down. Look at this, this is not fluffy. Just scrape it down and mix it up. Once it's light and fluffy, we're going to add three\neggs in one at a time. Let the first one incorporate\nbefore you add the next. Otherwise, you'll have an egg soup on top and solid butter on the bottom. Last egg. Now it's time for a tablespoon\nor 15 ML of a nice vanilla. This is the primary flavor in the cake, so, mm, don't skimp on it if possible. In you go. The smell is amazing, mm. One last scrape down, and then we're going\nto add the dry mixture and the buttermilk in alternating batches. Bring that flour back. I also measured out one cup of buttermilk. And just like with the eggs, if possible, everything should be room temperature. You don't want to add ice-cold\ningredients into an oven, because then the cake\nwon't bake really evenly. You want it to bake nicely\nthroughout so it's pretty flat. If you don't, you're going to\nhave a big dome on the top, and the edges will be burnt. Okay, this looks beautiful. Really loose, light-colored mixture. If it looks a little\nbit broken, don't worry; it's all going to come\ntogether once we add the flour. As long as it's homogenous,\nyou're in the right. We're going to mix also on lowest speed. You do not want to overmix cake batter. That will get you in trouble. Just sprinkle it in, let it mix a bit, and then add in, mm,\n1/3 of the buttermilk. Repeat. We're going to mix this\nuntil it's almost combined. I do not want to see it fully mixed in, because we're going to finish\nthe cake batter off by hand. Right now, there's a\nlot of chunks of flour. Probably some butter\nhanging out here or there. But we're going to use our spatula and bring this all together. If you overmixed your cake\nbatter, it'll look perfect when comes out of the oven, but as soon as it cools\ndown, it'll contract, it'll be kind of gummy and tough, and just not melt in your mouth amazing. You do not want to develop the gluten. This is ready to go into our pans, so let's get those out. You should have just about 600\ngrams of cake batter per pan. So you can use a scale or\neyeball it, either way. I love using my scale. I'm only mentioning it\nbecause I actually get a lot of questions on how many\ngrams of cake batter per pan, so that's the answer. Give your pans a quick tap just to get any big air bubbles out. And you can also tap the\nsides to help them level out. Then they go into the oven at 350. But I'm going to use cake strips because I like my layers\nto be perfectly flat with no trimming, because\nthat's wasted cake. 350 for about 30 minutes. While my cake was cooling,\nI whipped up a batch of my simple vanilla buttercream. Click up here for that recipe. It is delicious and so easy. Before you use any buttercream, just use your spatula to\npress any air bubbles out so it decorates up nice and smooth. Transfer your frosting to a piping bag, and let's get to work. I'm working directly on a cake plate. Just add one dot of\nbuttercream on the bottom. Place that cake layer in the center. We're going to cover this with a generous layer\nof buttercream frosting. Give it a quick smooth\njust to even it out. Pop that second layer on. Sometimes you'll want to do a crumb coat, because cakes can be crumby, but you don't really need to. So I'll show you. All you'll want to do is cover the cake in one layer of buttercream, and then you can smooth it out. It's gonna look perfect. The key is really for the cake to be cool. Use an offset spatula and just smooth the top of the cake out. Smooth the side. This cake actually looks fine to me, but I'm gonna finish it off with a really easy spiral pattern. All you need is a rounded tip spatula or any implement and a cake\nturntable if you have one. Otherwise, smooth it out or swoop it up. Let's finish this off with\na sprinkle of sprinkles. To the sprinkle drawer. (chimes chime) Confetti sprinkles are\none of my favorite things. Just a few on the edge is all\nyou need for a lot of cheer. This is Brian's mom's birthday cake. It's her birthday today, so\nshe deserves all the treats. She's really wonderful. So I hope she likes it. If you like this video, check\nout my easy cake playlist. - Happy birthday, grandma. - Aw, should we take a bite? Okay, let's take a bite. Mm, how's it taste? - Good.\n- Oh, yay."}
{"RaLzxZryEoA": "Hey everybody, let's turn these eggs into fluffy Japanese pancakes! Give those eggs a good crack and separate the yolks from the whites. Making these pancakes fluffy might seem like rocket science, but don't sweat it. I've got all the tricks up my sleeve, and I'm spilling them in this video. Don't go anywhere unless you're heading out for eggs. Throw a splash of milk into the yolks. Milk helps to create a lighter, fluffier texture by adding moisture and contributing to the overall batter consistency. Adding vanilla extract would be a great touch; just make sure you don't accidentally use soy sauce instead. Unless you're feeling adventurous and really into unique flavors. Alright, let's add the flour. I'm a sifting nerd, but if you just dump it in, your pancakes will still be awesome. I use cake flour, but all-purpose works too. I'd suggest adding the flour little by little instead of dumping it all in at once. That way, the dough won't get too thick. We're aiming for a nice, creamy consistency. Now let's set this mix aside and give it some time. Next, let's dive into the whites. Grab your mixer and start whipping on low speed. If you want to whisk by hand, go for it, but it's going to be a workout. Once you see some foam, start adding the sugar bit by bit. Gradually crank up the mixer speed to high. Oh, and I almost forgot—it's a really good idea to pop the egg whites in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes before you start whipping them. Cold egg whites trap air more effectively, which results in a fluffier, more stable meringue. Whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form, but don't go too far. Once they're shiny and can hold their shape, stop. I once messed up by whipping them too much, and the batter ended up too runny. We finally made it! Add about a third of the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture. Stir it well until smooth, but leave the mixer out of it. Drop a comment below and let me know which country you're watching from. Now pour this mixture into the rest of the egg whites. While you're at it, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how I can make my videos even better. Gently fold it all together with a spatula. Don't use a whisk or mixer—keeping it light and airy is key. This technique creates air pockets that make the pancakes rise to incredible heights when cooked. Let's grab a pastry bag. If you're feeling rebellious, you can totally skip it and just go without. Transfer the mixture into a pastry bag. If you don't have one, no worries—just use a regular bag and cut off a corner. Actually, you can just gently spoon the mixture if you prefer. Turn the stove to low heat. As you can see, I keep the flame super low so it doesn't go out. Give it a quick oiling. Getting the right heat is crucial for making Japanese pancakes. If it's too high, the pancakes will puff up fast but also deflate just as quickly once you take them out of the pan. Now gently squeeze the batter onto the preheated skillet. You'll notice it holds its shape and doesn't spread out. That's your meringue flexing its muscles,  showing it’s whipped to perfection! Let's pick up the pace and jump ahead. Add a few drops of water to the pan. This will create steam to help the pancakes stay moist. Cover with a lid and cook for 7 to 10 minutes. It should cook very low and slow. Try not to lift the lid. Nice job! Now let's flip these bad boys without making a mess. Honestly, I'm a bit nervous—I’ve had some epic fails before. If you like my video, don't forget to subscribe. Just under a million subscribers to get to a million! So far, so good. Let's toss in a few more drops of water, slap a lid on it, and let it cook for another 5 minutes or so. Getting pancakes fluffy takes a bit of effort. I had a few flops before nailing it, but even when they didn’t look perfect, they were still soft, tender, and tasty. From my experience, the secret to fluffy pancakes is whipping the meringue just right and cooking on low heat. Thanks for watching! See you later."}
{"Q3xg35pcLyo": "(optimistic music) (grunting) - Hey everybody, it's Natasha\nof natashaskitchen.com and today I'm gonna teach you how we make our all-time\nfavorite bruschetta. That's how they pronounce\nit in Italian, I hope. (laughs) Anyway, this is a crowd-pleasing appetizer and wait 'til you see what\nwe put on top of these at the very end. Aw, it's so good. (giggling) Okay I'm hungry, let's get started. We'll start with six medium Roma tomatoes or about one 1/2 pounds and if you have access\nto homegrown tomatoes, that's even better. Remove the cores, then dice\nup all of your tomatoes. We love using our favorite\nfood chopper for this. It makes tomato bruschetta so easy. I'll leave a link to\nthis tool in the notes. Once your tomatoes are all chopped up, you'll wanna drain off any excess liquid. Transfer your tomatoes\nto a medium mixing bowl and now we're gonna get\nstarted on the fresh basil. Because this has so few ingredients, getting the best ingredients\nis really important, so you'll wanna use fresh basil. Pluck off one third cup\nof fresh basil leaves. Because basil is such a delicate herb, the way you slice it is important so you don't crush the basil. Stack the leaves, then roll them up. Now use a sharp knife to thinly slice or chiffonade the basil into thin ribbons. Add your chopped basil to the tomatoes. (upbeat music) Now, onto the garlic which adds amazing flavor to bruschetta. Finely mince about five cloves of garlic and you can add the garlic to taste. (upbeat music) And before we forget,\nyou'll wanna set aside about one garlic cloves\nworth of minced garlic. Transfer that to a small bowl with three tablespoons of\nextra virgin olive oil. We'll need that for later. Add the rest of the chopped\ngarlic to your tomato mixture. We're gonna finish off that tomato mixture with two tablespoons of\nextra virgin olive oil, one tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, half a teaspoon of salt and a quarter teaspoon of black pepper. Stir that together to combine. We're gonna set that aside to marinate for about 15 to 30 minutes and, oh, does this mixture smell so good. (upbeat music) Meanwhile preheat your oven\nto 400 degrees Fahrenheit with the rack in the center of the oven. You'll need one, long baguette and this happens to be a French baguette. Cut that into half inch thick slices and I like to cut them diagonally for a prettier presentation. Now arrange the toast on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Now, remember that olive oil that we infused with fresh, minced garlic? We're gonna brush that on\nboth sides of the toasts. Now, flip 'em over and repeat. You'll wanna use up all of\nthat garlic-infused olive oil. Once those are all oiled up, you'll wanna top each\ntoast with a little bit of shredded Parmesan cheese and I'm using about one third to one\nhalf cup total cheese. (giggling) Now, bake at 400 degrees\nFahrenheit for about five minutes, then increase the heat\nto broil on high heat for one to two minutes or until\nthe edges are golden brown. Oh, it is time for the taste test and when I'm serving these\nfor a gathering or party, I like to put them on a platter and just keep the tomato part and the bread separate. This way the breads stay extra crisp and people can just build their own. Okay, 'cause once you have\nthat topping on there, you'll wanna eat it\npretty quickly afterwards. 'Cause it'll soften up the bread. Ah, and these are so crisp. All right, I'm excited\nand I'm gonna show you my favorite way to build these. These bruschetta or bruschetta. So, we're gonna make a few of 'em. Okay. So, first pile it high\nwith this tomato mixture. This adds so much great flavor. Love the freshness of tomatoes and, when they're in\nseason, this is even better. So, you have to try this\nwith fresh tomatoes. And one more. Again, lots of tomatoes. Pile 'em high. Now for just a little extra topping, you can either drizzle them with some extra virgin olive oil. So, we'll do one of those\nwith oil, just a little bit. It adds that fresh olive oil flavor and my personal favorite\nand this is so good. This is something that I\nlearned from a restaurant that we went to and we\nordered their bruschetta and it was just life-changing. (laughs) This recipe's actually based on that. So, this is our balsamic glaze. We have a really easy\nhomemade version of this or you can use a store-bought one. But you can just drizzle\na little bit over the top as a garnish and it adds\nreally great flavor. Okay, so we're gonna do this taste test 'cause I can not wait any longer. I'm gonna go the one with the balsamic,\nmy favorite first. (hums) This is so delicious. (giggles) I love how that Parmesan cheese adds that little salty bite to the toast and they are so crispy on the outside, but still soft on the inside and then that tomato topping\nwith the fresh basil. It has this punch of\ngarlic which is so nice. But it's mellowed out\nbecause it's been sitting and marinating for a little bit. This is amazing, totally\nrestaurant quality. It feels like you're sitting\nin an Italian bistro. Do they have bistros in Italy? I don't know. (laughs) It's good. I hope you guys find this to be a new favorite for you and I have to taste test the other one because I have to. I have to tell you how\nit tastes, you know? Okay. (humming) So crunchy. Really, really good. Get the best quality\nolive oil you can find. 'Cause this is so simple,\nsimple ingredients. So, when you can get the best ingredients, it makes all the difference. I hope these become a new favorite for you and we'll see you in our next video. Yeah, I'm gonna come into\nthe scene with my mitten. My mitten. (clapping)\nOkay. Oh. (chuckling) Hello. (laughs) Hello. (laughing) Nope, nope, let's do one more. (laughs) That looks really ugly. I kind of forgot to arrange them. (sighs) (laughs)"}
{"dYgRHTSdOGE": "so there's a number of things that we go out and order and everything to make and you might think well i don't even know if i can make that at home well the answer with this is you can it's easier than you think and it might just be one of the greatest things that you ever make [Music] okay so we're making one of my favorite things of all time fresh spring rolls not the fried kind now obviously we know the crunchy ones with vegetables and maybe a little bit of meat whatever these are the ones that are translucent you can see a little bit of the shrimp peeking through or sometimes there's pork or whatever and then there's rice noodles it's crunchy it's sweet it's a little salty there's just everything you want and obviously you can't forget the peanut sauce but another thing you can't forget is today's sponsor which is spam yes spam one of the most chef revered canned products of all time you might be thinking josh well wait you're sponsored by spam why uh well first off this goes way back for me i'm talking like down to learning about cooking learning about chefs and what they do and working with chefs many of my chef friends love this ingredient because it is so versatile you can see it you could base it you could do so much with it and here they are knock that off the bucket list we're sponsored by spam so really we have two recipes here we have a traditional one and then we have a little surprise from our friends at spam so with all that said let's make this shall we now the actual making and rolling of spring rolls doesn't really require much effort or time but we first have to make all the components first let's talk rice vermicelli noodles you can get these at asian markets or maybe if your local grocer is a homie you might be able to get it there too you'll need about five to six ounces of these prepare them according to the package directions these just say to boil for about six minutes now once they're done plunge them in an ice water bath until completely cold this feels nice then rinse them thoroughly that's it now let's make the peanut sauce that's peanut sauce yanaiste so you just start with half a cup or 148 grams of hoisin sauce a quarter cup or 60 grams of smooth peanut butter 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of sambal or any sort of spicy you like 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of rice vinegar this is a fancy yuzu rice vinegar 2 cloves of grated garlic and finally thin it out with a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of warm water whisk that together and then drink the entire thing just kidding that would probably not probably wouldn't feel great it's pretty intense uh next up is gonna be fried crispy shallots and they're very easy just get yourself about six to eight shallots cut their tops off and peel them but leaving them whole then i would really recommend using a mandolin over a knife and slice them a little thinner than a quarter of an inch once you have all your slices get a deep pan like a cast iron skillet and fill it up with at least one and a half inches of oil add your shallot in yes while it's cold then place it over medium high heat and while that's coming up you're going to constantly stir them with a pair of chopsticks you'll notice that they start to bubble and then fry and just keep stirring and frying you'll know they're almost done once they begin to stop bubbling so much and they start to color please understand these will color very fast and burn very quickly if you don't pay attention once the bubbling begins to subside and they're almost to a nice golden brown immediately remove them and drain them on a paper towel you pull them a little bit before because they will continue to brown after pulled out of the oil oh my gosh it's time for papa learning corner you know the reason why that matters is it's called heat carryover that's because heat continues to stay after you remove it from a hot area it's not like it just instantly goes away let this cool completely and you have crunchy shallots now these won't be used in the traditional shrimp one but the way that i like to plate up the peanut sauce is i like to take a small handful of toasted peanuts and a small handful of your crispy shallots place them in a bag and beat them lovingly with a mallet or a pot until you get a nice little crumble and i like to sprinkle that on top of my peanut sauce when serving but we're getting ahead of ourselves here okay so we have the majority of our components let's start with a traditional shrimp spring roll fill a medium sized pot with water place it on your stove and bring it to a boil optionally you can add aromatics like shallot or ginger like i did here once it comes to a boil drop in one pound of peeled and deveined shrimp cover with the lid and turn the heat off and let them poach for three to four minutes then remove them and immediately drop them into an ice water bath to cool and that's it you have beautifully poached shrimp now to assemble our shrimp spring roll first get a medium-sized bowl add in one to two julienne carrots i used a julienne peeler by the way for this one ew josh is cheating when yeah well you know what it was faster all right one to two thai chilies that have been thinly sliced a quarter cup or five grams of torn mint a quarter cup or five grams of torn cilantro and a quarter cup or six grams of torn thai basil hit that with the zest of one lime and toss together to combine now we're ready to assemble get some round rice paper sheets these are also available at asian markets also have a link in the description fill a large bowl with enough warm water to submerge it in and well submerge one rice paper sheet for about two to three seconds or until it becomes a little bit malleable pull it out place it on a cutting board add a few leaves of lettuce of your choice these are little baby boston leaves followed by your vermicelli noodles i mean look at those dangly boys some of your carrot herb salad followed by more lettuce and of course your poached shrimp which by the way have been sliced in half like so arrange your shrimp as you like to make a nice little design then fold the right side over then the left side over and well roll it all the way up it's kind of like a rice paper burrito in a way place it to the side and then repeat with the rest of your shrimp ones and you have a beautiful shrimp spring roll one of my favorite things about spring rolls you can do this this is the true original glizzy there was no other glizzy until this homemade spring rolls extremely easy but without further ado a little dunkaroo oh my [ __ ] fell out go back in here funny man stop looking at me vikram maybe it's because it has everything that i want in it but to me this is the perfect spring roll traditional it's relaxed it's great for when it's hot outside but you can also eat this during the winter and be perfectly happy all the flavors match beautifully one thing that i would note is when you make it yourself i mean you are essentially probably going to make the best spring roll you've ever had because you're putting everything that you want in it now tradition is great but what if we made a little bit of a upgraded version if you will this one's for the chefs get yourself one spam classic can remove your spam and cut it into quarter inch slices like so then cut those slices in half to get some nice little rectangles get yourself a medium sized pan heat it over medium high heat with enough oil to coat the bottom and once that's ripping hot add your spam in batches to avoid overcrowding and sear for about two minutes or till beautifully seared and crispy give it a flip and sear for an additional two minutes now another thing you can do is brush it with some hoisin sauce after you flipped it and brulee it with a kitchen torch to get a little bit of a glaze optional but uh recommended in a small bowl add 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated sugar and whisk in 1 tablespoon or 15 milliliters of hot water whisk that until mostly dissolved then add 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of lime juice and 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of fish sauce whisk it together and adjust acidity and sweetness if needed i know i have more than three here that's because today the grocery store decided to only supply tiny little baby ugly garlic followed by two thai chilies that have been very thinly sliced whistled together and you've got a nakcham dressing now we're gonna assemble this similarly but with one small change get yourself one cucumber cut off the ends and cut it in half then using a mandolin or a sharp knife shave it into nice little ribbons like so almost like a pappardelle pasta now to assemble this it's very similar rehydrate one of your rice papers place it on your cutting board and evenly shingle four ribbons across the center of your rice paper keep them nice and uniform like this and press them down so that they stick then add your lettuce and your vermicelli noodles that look like i don't know like little intestines for some reason uh sorry that's gross your carrot herb salad from earlier then lightly dress those noodles in your nacho dressing more lettuce a generous handful of your fried shallots i mean look at that that alone would be a perfect roll add your seared and glazed spam i cut this one in half again so that it would fit a little better fold the right side over then the left side and yet again starting from the bottom roll all the way up and around to create the most beautiful almost green glizzy spring roll you know this looks so beautiful on the outside i think we need to get ourselves a little cross section and i mean other than that annoying noodle that's sticking right there that is one of the most beautiful cross sections i think i've ever seen now let's give these a little taste test we have the spam enhanced ultra glizzy goblin spring roll now this kind of has a little bit of reminiscence to the asian hawaiian combo of the spam misubi but now we've got sort of a vietnamese sort of combo going on with the spam [Music] sauce spam your chewing the fresh nakcham hits you've got the lettuce and then that salty fatty rich whippy and glazed spam hits you i mean i don't think you could make a better version of this there is a pork version of a spring roll this out does that by a million and billion petrillion is that a word turn number not a is that a number i don't know the difference i don't know different numbers but really whether you're more traditional you know you want the traditional shrimp lettuce a little bit of carrot nothing else cool then this is your your way to go but if you want to go on a roller coaster to flavor town then spam spring roll this peanut sauce is so good i don't have many words this is just so good honestly the spam one has more of an asian taste to it than this thank you for letting us eat jelly thank you but do you want to know what else is a green glizzy these are just making less and less sense every day [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made spring rolls first off humongous thank you and shout out to spam for sponsoring this video and for making these spring rolls one of the most delicious spring rolls i think i've ever made and you even saw vikram and tj both of them actually liked the spam one more we're really upping what we consider tradition and i think it's just one of those things you see respect being paid but you also bring in a new thing to sort of a traditional flavor and now you have these two combos that then make something greater than the sum of its parts kind of like how spam misubi was invented so i don't know if we invented a new spring roll but if we did hey remember the josh weissman coin and if you use it that'll be about 300 billion dollars so just just you know you could just keep a jug of this peanut sauce in your refrigerator and just maybe if you walk by the fridge you know pop the top take a little sip that's gross maybe not that but if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time

{"LKuF1DTyVGY": "[Music] making your own Samo rups at home is just so easy hey friends this is a very easy recipe that yields very crispy samosas that you can do on any day of the week and you and your family will definitely enjoy for this recipe measure four cups all purpose flour into this [Music] bowl into the bowl a teaspoon koser salt half a teaspoon sugar whisk everything together into the bowl I'm going to add one cup water but I'm going to start with a half of it and then add as needed then with a spatula I'm going to bring this together to start forming a dough [Music] we are looking for a dough here with the same consistency as a [Music] chapati [Music] we'll move this to a d mat and continue working on it incorporate all the flour here for me this dough doesn't need any more water although it feels like it's a little hard but remember it's going to continue absorbing the water that you have used but always don't shy away to add a little few drops of water if you feel like you need it now this door is almost there as you can see it's almost springing back it needs some rest just finish this with a touch of olive oil maybe a teaspoon now shap this dough in into a bowl give it a good rest about half an hour wrap it leave it alone this dough is all rested so feels very nice and soft so now I'm going to roll this into a long log and then cut it into pieces see how smooth it's become it's absorbed all the moisture that was in it all the water and this is ready to be rolled so cut this two into a half and then half into halves and then continue cutting a half now cut these pieces into another half and then I'm going to form them into small balls like so and then I'll continue this process process until all these are cut into halves and shaped into small balls and then have them rest I'm all done rolling this into these small balls so 1 2 3 4 five about 15 pieces because I had to readjust and make them about fairly same size now I'll bring the plastic wrap back have them rest for about 10 minutes also now these dough balls look all rested you can just see how they springing back so divide them into five Lots then I'm going to find a spot to keep them for our next part I need a rolling pin some extra flour here for dusting a brush and some olive oil dust the mat here with a touch of flour take one of these balls just spread it a tiny bit some flour using a rolling pin just make a small circle probably just about maybe 5 in or so just like so I'll put it aside one more dust It and Roll to the same size as the other one now on to the last one just roll it just like the other ones boom that's done so now I'll go back to the fast one late right here spread some olive oil right on top and then just just spread it dust with flour lay one of these right on top repeat some oil brush dust with flour lay one more right on top and then keep doing this repeating the process so remember we are doing this in batches of five it going to be easier to work with so they'll lay the last one right here on top then just make sure that they all lined up just fail the lined up and then move this put it aside just cover with some plastic wrap take one more do the same process some oil brush flour top with one more and then continue until they are all done now dust the mat with some fresh flour here and then bring the fastest tuck some flour ad dusting on top Now using my mat as a guide I'm going to roll one of these tacks into about 14 in uh Pizza size so just make sure that they are all stuck together spread some flour right on top and then I'll start rolling this into a circle about 14 in my cast iron is about 15 in also so I'll need some allowance so that's Loosely about 14 in wide this will go onto a hot cast iron just carefully lay it so it snuggly fits and let this cook for low medium until it just slightly Bubbles and then you want to give it a turn now once the slight bubble starts to here pinch it in one corner give it just a turn you can help it with a spatula just press it all around pinch it again so this is a quick process at this point you want to be careful you don't want to cook it all the way you're not looking for any color and this for me is all done so take one more stack dust some flour and and repeat the [Music] process and let's quickly as you put it on this is basically done now bring the wraps onto a work table and all we want to do now is just peel them just so carefully so you want to get to one end and then just peel this off just carefully lay it right on top keep repeating the process until you get these very thin sheets of dough just like so so you want to be careful with this you want to work very fast at this stage because they tend to dry out just so quickly because of how thin they are so get all these so keep peeling this beautifully thin and delicate shets I'm going to separate this into a few batches here again so always be careful with them take this so all I want to do with this just trim the rough in edges here with a sharp knife I don't have to be exact if you're looking for perfect circles you can do that I don't need to because eventually this will form into triangles this makes perfect chips you can fry those now go into the rough middle of this cut it all the way and then turn them just carefully stack them again then go into quarters and you end up with these beautiful triangles I'll put this aside and this cut into thirs then and stick this together and you have an idea you get those more like Spring Row wraps so I'll go ahead and finish them all so boom all done now I have some prepared Samosa mix here this is all beef mildly spice I always make a big lot and then have it in the freezer so I def roasted this and it's ready to go check out the recipe on how to do this on my channel I'll will share it on top somewhere this is very popular with my clients now this aside for a second prepare the paste about 2 tbspoon all Peppers flour just a touch of water it really doesn't matter you can use egg wash too that's all set all you need is just a sort of a rough paste this will be our glue now pick up one of these triangle all I want to do is just bring it all the way almost close to the center and then with a brush get some of this paste just a little bit not too much and then just aach in the inside and then I'm going to bring the other corner here just lay it right on top of this one and then lift the holding up and then you got this nice pocket that you can fill with whatever you filling your samosas with in our case we have this beef so this goes back onto our pen so repeat repeat until I'm all done with this batch so one more paste bring this wrap it you get a pocket you filling get it in get this if it seems like it's opening at the bottom you can always readjust so get this and relign it so the key is to make sure that you have a tight seal so the oil doesn't get in so get the bigger flap get the paste bring all the way again another triangle now bring the spring roll style and then all I want to do with this just get one corner here bring it make a pocket by lining all these and just as the other ones get the Samosa mix and then you got that r rough triangle I'll pick another one so you want to pick one corner of this very delicate flap bring it all the way to this side like so and then fold it over and then lift this up so some o mix this one you can actually just lay it at the bottom and then just roll it over along the lines and then this remaining flap just paste it with your glue and you get that a triangle so I'll finish the [Music] rest so now fry this into a 350 F oil ready to [Music] enjoy this takes just about 3 minutes to four all you're looking here is just for the color and just reheat the [Music] filling when I make this reminds me of street food in Kenya especially Mombasa Nairobi all major Urban centers you'll find these samosas fried all across and they're very delicious once you satisfied with the color take them off just listen to that very crispy go in with the last batch so there you go all done frying [Music] so friends there you have it a recipe that you can do on any day of the week and you and your family will definitely enjoy I occasionally like to use this recipe although I can admit I like like to buy uh my wraps ready prepared especially when I'm doing my catering orders but this is something that you can do for you and your family so thank you so much for watching this one hey if you're not subscribed to this channel yet

{"G8xELw231qs": "Nick:\nI'm going to teach you everything you need to\nknow about steak. In this video, you'll learn how to cook the\nperfect steak as well as which steaks you should buy and more importantly, which\nsteaks not to buy. I'll also demonstrate the most popular\ncooking methods, including grilled, seared, reverse seared sous vide and broiled. I guarantee that if you watch this video,\nyou'll be a steak expert for life First. What makes a good steak? It all comes down to just one word: balance. And with steak, balance comes down to just\ntwo main things flavor and texture. You've probably heard the saying fat is\nflavor. Those little white fatty spots in meat are\ncalled marbling. When steak cooks, that fat melts into the\nmeat and keeps it tender and juicy while adding tons of great flavor. That's why it's so important to have that\nnice balance of fat. Those shots you just saw were Japanese a5\nWagyu, the nicest beef in the entire world. Different countries have their own grading\nsystems for marbling. The three main systems coming from the\nUnited States, Australia and Japan. These charts all rate based on the marbling,\nmeaning that the better the marbling, the more you'll probably pay. In front of me is\nevery single type of steak that comes from a cow before we cook. It is very important\nthat you understand which steaks come from, which portion of the cow, so that you'll be\nable to choose the right steak for you. You might already think you know which steaks\nyou like best, but what you're about to learn may completely change your mind. As I go through the steaks, I'm also going\nto add anywhere between 1 and $4 signs to show how expensive the steaks are here. I've broken down this cow into a few\ndifferent sections. You can get steak from the chuck rib loin\nflank and plate sections. Cuts that come from the round shank and brisket sections cannot\nbe cooked as a steak and typically have to be cooked low and slow. So even though I do love a good brisket, I\nwon't be discussing those today. Let's start with the Chuck section. From here we get the Chuck steak, which I\nlove because it comes from the first couple of cuts on the Chuck and is actually pretty\nsimilar to a ribeye steak but is much cheaper in price. The flatiron comes from the\nshoulder of the cow and is extremely tender with a good balance of marbling and an\nintense beefy flavor. Moving on to the rib section, we've got a\nribeye steak, which is my personal favorite. It has fantastic marbling and also contains\nthe cap, which is probably the best tasting meat in the entire cow. I'll demonstrate later in the video how to\ncook it and how to cut it. The loin section is a very tender part of\nthe cow, which makes for juicy but often very expensive steaks. You'll probably recognize\na lot of these. One of my favorites that comes from here is\nthe sirloin cap, popularly known as the Picanha. This is one of the most prized\nsteaks in all of Brazil, where it's often cooked over open flame. It's tender and juicy with a rich, beefy\nflavor and has a beautiful fat cap. The sirloin steak and the New York strip are\nboth less fatty than the ribeye with a great balance of tenderness and leanness. But I'd still choose a ribeye any day. The Porterhouse and T-Bone are both very\nsimilar in the sense that both steaks contain two cuts in one, both the filet and the\nstrip. The difference is the porterhouse has a\nlarger fillet and more fat content, which makes my personal preference the porterhouse\nover the T-Bone. Just be careful when cooking either of these\nsteaks because you're basically cooking two different steaks at the exact same time,\nwhich can make it hard to cook both perfectly. The filet mignon and the\ntenderloin both also come from the same section, but are highly overrated. Given how expensive these two cuts are, I\nwould suggest using your money to get something with more fat and therefore more\nflavor. Tri tip can also be tasty and typically has\ngreat marbling, but it's very tough and unforgiving if you overcook it. So I don't recommend this cut either. From the flank section comes the flank\nsteak, which is probably most recognizable as the beef that comes in your beef and\nbroccoli. If you order Chinese takeout, if you marinate\nit properly and cook it through to medium, it's delicious. Last but not least, we have\nthe short plate section. My favorite steak from here being the skirt\nsteak, specifically the outside skirt, which is more tender than the inside. Later in this video, we will cook and cut a\nskirt steak. And I really want to focus on the cutting\nportion of that because despite this being one of my favorite steaks out there, I was\ncutting it incorrectly most of my life. The final steak. And one of my other\npersonal favorites is the hanger steak. Let me tell you, if you haven't tried a\nhanger steak, you need to. It's also known as the butcher steak, since\nbutchers used to save this one for themselves. Trust me when I say you need to\ntry this one, you should use all of that information to find the best combination\nbetween flavor, cost and texture that works best for you. If you're still confused on\nwhat steaks to buy, ask your butcher or the person behind the meat counter at the\nsupermarket. I know they might look intimidating at\ntimes, but trust me when I say that they're gentle giants and they want to help you. Now that you know what steaks to buy,\nthere's just one last step before cooking. Seasoning. And the best part is it's very\nsimple. You'll just season with a high quality salt\nat least an hour before cooking your steak, if not overnight. This process is called dry\nbrining, and it's seasons. The whole steak, not just the very outside,\nwhich is what happens if you only salt right before cooking. Dry brining allows the salt\nto go into the meat so you get that flavor everywhere. You can also get creative with\nyour seasoning and use a marinade which works particularly well on steaks such as flank\nsteak and strip steak. I've seen tons of comments in the past\nasking me where my seasoning is if I've only used salt and pepper on a steak. But remember, there is nothing wrong with\nletting the flavor of steak speak for itself. Now that our steaks are seasoned, how do we\nknow which method to cook them with? There are plenty to choose from, but we'll do the best and most popular grilling,\nsearing, reverse, searing sous vide and broiling. And the best way to decide how to\ncook your steak comes down to one simple factor. Thickness. The focus here is cooking it evenly, all the\nway through to the center while still getting that nice crust on the outside. We're going to start with the most popular\nway to cook a steak, grilling. And as always, I'm looking for maximum\nflavor. So I'm going to start with the best charcoal\nyou can get anywhere in the world. This is called Binchotan Charcoal. I will warn you, it's probably going to be\nthe most expensive wood you ever buy, but it'll also probably be the best flavor you\never get. Once you've added this charcoal to our\nchimney starter, I'm going to go ahead and use my little trick of using Doritos as a\nfire starter because, believe it or not, Doritos light extremely well. I'll start by letting our Doritos on fire. And once they're going, I'll place my\ncharcoal on top. We'll let this go until our charcoal is\nfully on fire, at which point we want to let that die down to get these nice red, white,\nhot coals. It's hot enough now that I'm ready to pour\nthat charcoal into the grill and just look at that incredible glow that we've gotten since\nwe've already dry brined each of these steaks with salt. I'm going to go ahead and finish\nthem off now with some pepper you can save fresh cracked pepper for last minute just\nbefore you grill because this is probably too long for our grill. I'm also going to go\nahead and slice it in half. As you can see from the two steaks here, one\nis very thick and one is very thin. And as we talked about earlier, we're going\nto cook these in slightly different ways. With the skirt steak. It's extremely thin,\nso we'll want to sear it as quickly as possible. Once again, the goal here with\ncooking this thin steak is to cook it high and fast. We want to get that crust without\novercooking it. The ribeye will be a different story because\nthis charcoal is so hot, we're already ready to flip. I don't want to ruffle any\nfeathers, but to all the grill dads out there who are constantly touching and flipping\nyour steaks, just leave it. The only way you're going to get the proper\ncrust is if you let it sit there patiently on each side as long as you can. That right there is that perfect char that\nwe're looking for. I know you've probably heard a lot of people\ntalk about letting your steak rest, but in all seriousness, it's extremely important. I know you're probably tempted to dive right\nin, but you want those juices to stay sealed in the steak before you eat it. It's time to cook our ribeye. And as you can see, this is a much thicker\nsteak. And it's going to take a slightly different\ncooking method to get it done right. To begin, I'll start by rendering off that\nfat cap, which means we're going to start by cooking it with this thicker fat side down\nso that all that fat can get nice and crispy. The goal with this thicker steak here is\ngoing to be to get that nice crust and then move it off of the direct heat over here so\nthat it can continue staying warm and heat up the rest of the way through the center. If we kept it right over the charcoals\nthroughout the entire cooking process, we might actually burn the crust. And because it's a thicker steak, we need to\ngive it a little bit more time to cook all the way through and get that heat into the\ncenter. Now, once I've laid it down on the first\nside here, I'm going to leave it and let it sit until I feel that it's gotten the proper\ncrust. The reason we have a lot more flames with\nthis ribeye here is because there's so much more fat coming out of it. And all that fat, just like butter or oil is\ngoing to light on fire. I think it's already time to flip. Now that we've gotten a crust on both sides,\nI'm going to slide it over here to cook the rest of the way through. We've gotten a\nbeautiful char on this ribeye, which means tons and tons of flavor. Now that it's over indirect heat or not,\nright over the coals anymore, I'm going to cover it up so that all of that heat can go\nahead and cook it the rest of the way through, almost like a makeshift oven. While\nour ribeye finishes cooking. It's time to go ahead and cut one of our\nskirt steaks. When looking at it, at first glance, it might\nseem like you should cut it down the width, but the reason that's incorrect is because\nthat's cutting with the grain. And anytime we slice a steak, we want to cut\nagainst the grain. If you simply look at the direction that the\nfibers are going in, you can pretty easily tell that this grain goes along the width,\nwhich means we actually want to slice across the length of the steak. I'm going to cut it\nin half. So we have an easy piece to work with and\nthen begin slicing. This right here is perfectly cooked skirt\nsteak. And as you can see, because I've cut against\nthe grain, it's extremely soft and pull apart tender now that we've sliced all our skirt\nsteak, I have one last tip for you. Even though we let it rest for about ten\nminutes, we still have plenty of juices left on the board. And what I like to do is take\nall of my steak and drag it through all of those juices, and it's going to be\ndelicious. This here is a steak doneness chart that you\ncan use based on your own preferences and how you like your steak cooked with this steak\nhere, I'm using a thermometer that's measuring the internal temperature so I can\nknow when to pull it off the heat. And if you want it medium rare, you want to\ntake it off at about 130 Fahrenheit internal, which means we're a little behind. Always remember that there's going to be that\nresidual heat that continues cooking your steak even after you've taken it off the\ngrill. For example, this steak here is completely\noff the heat right now. But it's still very hot and will continue to\ncook through to the center as we let it rest. The ribeye has a few different sections, the\nmain two being the eye and the cap, The cap being one of the best tasting pieces of meat\nin the entire cow to carve it. I'm first going to remove the cap, which is\nalready somewhat separated but really is a separate piece from the eye. This piece here is typically mostly fat, so\nI can carve that off as well. With the skirt steak we talked about slicing\nagainst the grain, but the ribeye is already cut from the cow against the grain. We know that because we can see all the\nlittle muscle fibers sticking straight up here. This is great because it means there's\nno wrong way to cut a ribeye. If you're cooking ribeyes at a barbecue, the\nfat cap is what you should save for yourself. It is extremely juicy, extraordinarily\ntender, and the flavor just simply doesn't get better. And don't forget to always use\nall that juice. Oh, my God. Manny, take a bite. Manny: Oh, my God. So good. Nick:\nWhen it comes to searing, I actually\nsometimes prefer that method over grilling because I love the crust that you can get\nwhen searing a steak. But we can also add some incredible flavor\nhere through butter basting, which I'll show you shortly. For this method, we'll be using\na hanger steak. My preferred pan for searing a steak is a\ncast iron because it can get extremely hot and holds that heat very evenly. You'll want to begin by starting with some\noil that can get to a nice high smoke point. I like to add a little more oil in my pan\nthan most people do because I like that crust to get a little bit higher up on the steak. If you look carefully at any steak, there\nare quite a few crevices that will be in there and adding more oil is going to make\nsure that the oil goes up and inside those crevices and gets everything nice and\ncrispy. Once your oil is smoking hot, make sure you\ngo ahead and lay that steak away from you. Immediately, you're also going to want to\npress that steak down to make sure everything is touching the pan. If it bulges up, that's\nwhen you get these big, ugly gray spots and you're not going to get a good even crust. Once my steak is in, I'll slightly turn down\nthe heat so it doesn't burn. And once I've peeked on the underside of the\nsteak and it appears to have a nice crust, we'll go ahead and flip. That's a crust. Once that crust begins to form on the other\nside, this is when we can get some of that flavor I was talking about. Turn down your heat so the butter doesn't\nburn and add in a few cubes of butter. Then a few aromatics. Most commonly, people like to use garlic,\nsome rosemary and a little time. Once we've really made sure that all that\nbutter soaks up the flavor of those herbs and that garlic, I'm going to tilt that pan down\ntowards me to bring all the butter, but not the herbs over to this side. Then in a nice smooth motion, I'll start to\ncover my steak with butter over and over to give it all that flavor and cook it the rest\nof the way through. This is called butter basting. To rest my steak. I'm going to place it down\non my cutting board and use a little trick I learned from Gordon Ramsay himself. I'm going to take all my herbs and rest\nthose on top of the steak. And we also can't forget about that\ndelicious garlic. Then we can even pour over a little bit of\nthat oil and butter just to get those last bits of flavor. And that's how our steak\nwill rest. Once our steak has rested, we're going to\nslice into it. And once again, we want to make sure we're\nslicing against the grain, not with the grain. First, listen to this crust that we\njust got. What you're looking at here is why we rest\nour stakes. All that juice gets trapped inside. Whereas if we were to cut into it right\naway, that wouldn't happen. I got to feed my camera guy first. Manny: Can you take a bite? Nick:\nIs it good? Manny: That's amazing. Nick:\nIf you haven't tried hanger steak, go taste\nit. We'll move on to the reverse sear method. I'll be demonstrating this method with a\nporterhouse. And like I said, we have two different\nsteaks here, so I want to make sure we're getting them to the proper temperatures. These temperature probes will help us\nsimultaneously monitor both parts of the steak, given there are two different cuts. For a long time I'd heard of this term and\nhad absolutely no idea what it was. But it's actually very simple. Instead of trying to get the crust right\naway, we're going to put this on a cold pan into the oven and cook it until the internal\ntemperature reads about 125 or 130 Fahrenheit. It's time to take out our steak\nand finish it with a sear because as you can see, we need a nice crust. I want you to understand that this steak\nright here is already cooked perfectly, similar to sous vide, which we'll do\nshortly. It just doesn't yet have a crust and we want\na bit of a higher internal temperature. We'll go into our pan with a bit of high\nheat oil. And because this has a fat cap just like\nthat ribeye that we grilled, we're going to go ahead and start fat side. Now, if you don't render off the fat like\nthis, it's basically inedible. But if you cook it to a nice golden brown\nlike this, it's delicious. Once we've rendered off that fat cap, we can\nlay down our steak once again laying away from us so we don't get hit with oil. Once we've gotten a nice crust, it's time to\nflip. One reason lots of people like to reverse\nsear is they believe that by putting the steak in the oven, it really dries it out\nand gives you a nicer crust. The same thing that happens when you dry\nbrown your steak. Once you've gotten a crust on both sides,\nour steak is done. And after letting it take a nice nap, I'll\nplace it back on my cutting board and it's time to slice. I'll start by slicing the\nfilet right off the bone and it should cleanly come right out. Then I'll cut down the other side of the\nbone to get the strip. And I can already tell we've cooked this\nsteak perfectly. And now we get a nice taste of filet mignon. I know I said it's overrated, but I didn't\nsay it wasn't good. And a delicious New York strip. Nailed it. Once you've cooked one of these steaks, you\ncan certainly see why it's called a T-Bone. Moving on to one of my favorite methods to\ncook a steak. We'll be doing this picanha sous vide. I'll lay it fat side down and then begin\nslicing this into nice, thick steaks. You might notice that right now we're\nslicing with the grain instead of against the grain. And that's because once we cook this\nlater as a steak, we'll be able to slice it against the grain before we eat it. With Picanha, we want to focus on the flavor,\nso we're only going to hit it with a touch of salt. Sous vide is when you vacuum, seal\nyour food in a bag and then cook it in a precisely regulated water bath. The steak is cooked in its own juices and\nshould come out extremely tender. You'll probably want to get a nice vacuum\nsealer like this one because the goal is to make sure you get all the air out of that\nbag and get a nice tight seal. And it's a satisfying and extremely easy\nprocess. This is a circulator that's going to keep\nour water at the same temperature the entire time our steak cooks. Some people could call\nit lazy, but the reality is it's going to cook the steak to the perfect, perfect\ntemperature every single time. The only thing we don't get from sous vide\nis that nice crust on the outside of our steak. So we're going to set the temperature\na little bit below what we want it to end up at so that when our steak has reached that\ninternal temperature that we want, we can sear it off, which will bring it up a few\ndegrees, get us that nice crust and get us to the perfect temperature that we're looking\nfor. As you'll notice, the steak is pretty floppy\nand mushy and doesn't really have much color to it. But remember, this steak is cooked to\na perfect medium rare right now. You could eat it and be totally fine. It just lacks any texture. And that's why we need to get that crust\nbecause there's so much fat on my picanha I'm going to start by just rendering off that\nfat on the top. We might actually get enough oil out of this\nthing to sear the rest of the steak without even having to add anything. As I cook this, I'm going to move it around\nthe pan, pressing on all corners and sides to really melt down all that fat. Once our fat cap looks like this, it's time\nto see our steak. If your picanha doesn't look like this,\nyou're doing it wrong. The  Picanha had some time to rest and as\nyou can see, the grain runs along the length, so we'll be cutting across the width. I am very excited to dive into this steak. What's amazing about a bite like this is\nthat it's got beautiful marbling in the center. That nice little piece of rendered\noff fat cap on the top and a beautiful crust on the outside. There's a reason this is one\nof my favorite steaks in the entire world. The final method we'll test today is\nbroiling. And for that, we're going to be using this\nChuck steak. Buying a chuck steak is going to get you\nsomething very similar to a ribeye without that steep cost. I've talked today about making a simple\nmarinade for your steak and we're going to make one now. I'll add some lemon zest,\nlemon juice, a few cloves of garlic, a few Calabrian chilies, some rosemary and olive\noil. Once we've blended it up, I'll finish it\nwith just a touch of salt and a bit of black pepper. Ideally, we would have marinated\nthis steak overnight, but since we didn't get to do it ahead of time, I have another great\ntrick for you. I'll place my steak into this food saver\ncontainer, then pour over that marinade fully covering the steak with all this\ndeliciousness. Then I'll add back on this lid, make sure\nit's nice and tightly sealed. And using this machine we used earlier, I'm\ngoing to go ahead and marinate. And what we're doing here now is called\nrapid infusion. What we're doing is sucking out all of that\nair and speeding up the marination process by forcing that flavor into our steak. I'll let this sit for about 15 minutes to\nlet all that flavor do its thing, and then we're ready to broil. At this point, our\nflavors should be pretty infused, so I'm going to release the pressure and open it\nup. The smell of this marinade is unbelievable. Now that all that flavor has soaked deep\ninto our steak, we'll go ahead and transfer. For to a sheet tray where we're going to\nbroil it before you broil position that oven rack to one of the upper levels. And once you've set your oven to about as\nhigh as it can go and goes your steak. Once we can see that our steak has gotten a\nnice crust on the top and is beginning to sizzle, I'm going to go ahead and pull my\ntray out, give it a nice flip and back in we go after we've cooked about five minutes on\neither side, our steak should be done, so it's time to let it take a little nap. This one turns out extremely tender after\ncooking, but certainly looks a bit messier. So you can use your best judgment when it\ncomes time to slice the steak. Might be the most tender we've had today,\nand it's definitely nice and juicy. The fun thing also about using a marinade,\nit can make it taste however you like. I'm hoping that after watching this video,\nyou'll be a true master when it comes to I love steak."}
{"EYXQmbZNhy8": "- Today, I'm teaching you how to make the only vanilla cake\nrecipe you'll ever need. And if you like this video, don't forget to hit that\nLike button and subscribe. Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. This cake will be ready\nbefore you know it, so let's get started. First off, set your oven to 350 and prep your two eight-inch pans. You could also make this with three six-inch pans if you want. Going to give the sides\na nice bit of butter, a little for the bottom, and then just place\nthat sheet right there. A circle of parchment\npaper is your insurance for no broken or cracked\ncakes when they release; that is heartbreak. For this cake, we're using 2 1/2 cups or 280 grams of all-purpose flour. This cake will be the best if you measure your flour the right way, which is with a scale. If you're not using a\nscale, fluff the flour up and then sprinkle it\ninto your measuring cup. Now we're adding 3/4 of a teaspoon of salt and 2 1/4 teaspoons of baking powder. Now we're going to sift\nit up and whisk it out. (chuckles) Now we're going to sift\nit out and whisk it up. Set it aside. All right, let's get that stand mixer. For this cake, we're using 3/4 of a cup or 170 grams of room\ntemperature unsalted butter. And room temperature means\nyou can press into the butter, and it'll yield to the touch. We're going to cream the butter up so it is nice and smooth\nbefore we add the sugar. And while we cream it up, we can crack three eggs into a small bowl. You do not want any shells in\nyour delicious vanilla cake. (upbeat music) Our butter is nice and creamed up. You can always scrape the\nbowl down a little bit before you add another ingredient in. We want a homogenous mixture. Now we're going to add 1 2/3\ncups of granulated sugar; that's 333 grams. Add it in while it's mixing. Increase to high and\nget it nice and fluffy. Mix for three minutes. It looks fluffy on top, but not so much on the bottom, so we're going to scrape it down. Look at this, this is not fluffy. Just scrape it down and mix it up. Once it's light and fluffy, we're going to add three\neggs in one at a time. Let the first one incorporate\nbefore you add the next. Otherwise, you'll have an egg soup on top and solid butter on the bottom. Last egg. Now it's time for a tablespoon\nor 15 ML of a nice vanilla. This is the primary flavor in the cake, so, mm, don't skimp on it if possible. In you go. The smell is amazing, mm. One last scrape down, and then we're going\nto add the dry mixture and the buttermilk in alternating batches. Bring that flour back. I also measured out one cup of buttermilk. And just like with the eggs, if possible, everything should be room temperature. You don't want to add ice-cold\ningredients into an oven, because then the cake\nwon't bake really evenly. You want it to bake nicely\nthroughout so it's pretty flat. If you don't, you're going to\nhave a big dome on the top, and the edges will be burnt. Okay, this looks beautiful. Really loose, light-colored mixture. If it looks a little\nbit broken, don't worry; it's all going to come\ntogether once we add the flour. As long as it's homogenous,\nyou're in the right. We're going to mix also on lowest speed. You do not want to overmix cake batter. That will get you in trouble. Just sprinkle it in, let it mix a bit, and then add in, mm,\n1/3 of the buttermilk. Repeat. We're going to mix this\nuntil it's almost combined. I do not want to see it fully mixed in, because we're going to finish\nthe cake batter off by hand. Right now, there's a\nlot of chunks of flour. Probably some butter\nhanging out here or there. But we're going to use our spatula and bring this all together. If you overmixed your cake\nbatter, it'll look perfect when comes out of the oven, but as soon as it cools\ndown, it'll contract, it'll be kind of gummy and tough, and just not melt in your mouth amazing. You do not want to develop the gluten. This is ready to go into our pans, so let's get those out. You should have just about 600\ngrams of cake batter per pan. So you can use a scale or\neyeball it, either way. I love using my scale. I'm only mentioning it\nbecause I actually get a lot of questions on how many\ngrams of cake batter per pan, so that's the answer. Give your pans a quick tap just to get any big air bubbles out. And you can also tap the\nsides to help them level out. Then they go into the oven at 350. But I'm going to use cake strips because I like my layers\nto be perfectly flat with no trimming, because\nthat's wasted cake. 350 for about 30 minutes. While my cake was cooling,\nI whipped up a batch of my simple vanilla buttercream. Click up here for that recipe. It is delicious and so easy. Before you use any buttercream, just use your spatula to\npress any air bubbles out so it decorates up nice and smooth. Transfer your frosting to a piping bag, and let's get to work. I'm working directly on a cake plate. Just add one dot of\nbuttercream on the bottom. Place that cake layer in the center. We're going to cover this with a generous layer\nof buttercream frosting. Give it a quick smooth\njust to even it out. Pop that second layer on. Sometimes you'll want to do a crumb coat, because cakes can be crumby, but you don't really need to. So I'll show you. All you'll want to do is cover the cake in one layer of buttercream, and then you can smooth it out. It's gonna look perfect. The key is really for the cake to be cool. Use an offset spatula and just smooth the top of the cake out. Smooth the side. This cake actually looks fine to me, but I'm gonna finish it off with a really easy spiral pattern. All you need is a rounded tip spatula or any implement and a cake\nturntable if you have one. Otherwise, smooth it out or swoop it up. Let's finish this off with\na sprinkle of sprinkles. To the sprinkle drawer. (chimes chime) Confetti sprinkles are\none of my favorite things. Just a few on the edge is all\nyou need for a lot of cheer. This is Brian's mom's birthday cake. It's her birthday today, so\nshe deserves all the treats. She's really wonderful. So I hope she likes it.

{"RaLzxZryEoA": "Hey everybody, let's turn these eggs into fluffy Japanese pancakes! Give those eggs a good crack and separate the yolks from the whites. Making these pancakes fluffy might seem like rocket science, but don't sweat it. I've got all the tricks up my sleeve, and I'm spilling them in this video. Don't go anywhere unless you're heading out for eggs. Throw a splash of milk into the yolks. Milk helps to create a lighter, fluffier texture by adding moisture and contributing to the overall batter consistency. Adding vanilla extract would be a great touch; just make sure you don't accidentally use soy sauce instead. Unless you're feeling adventurous and really into unique flavors. Alright, let's add the flour. I'm a sifting nerd, but if you just dump it in, your pancakes will still be awesome. I use cake flour, but all-purpose works too. I'd suggest adding the flour little by little instead of dumping it all in at once. That way, the dough won't get too thick. We're aiming for a nice, creamy consistency. Now let's set this mix aside and give it some time. Next, let's dive into the whites. Grab your mixer and start whipping on low speed. If you want to whisk by hand, go for it, but it's going to be a workout. Once you see some foam, start adding the sugar bit by bit. Gradually crank up the mixer speed to high. Oh, and I almost forgot—it's a really good idea to pop the egg whites in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes before you start whipping them. Cold egg whites trap air more effectively, which results in a fluffier, more stable meringue. Whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form, but don't go too far. Once they're shiny and can hold their shape, stop. I once messed up by whipping them too much, and the batter ended up too runny. We finally made it! Add about a third of the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture. Stir it well until smooth, but leave the mixer out of it. Drop a comment below and let me know which country you're watching from. Now pour this mixture into the rest of the egg whites. While you're at it, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how I can make my videos even better. Gently fold it all together with a spatula. Don't use a whisk or mixer—keeping it light and airy is key. This technique creates air pockets that make the pancakes rise to incredible heights when cooked. Let's grab a pastry bag. If you're feeling rebellious, you can totally skip it and just go without. Transfer the mixture into a pastry bag. If you don't have one, no worries—just use a regular bag and cut off a corner. Actually, you can just gently spoon the mixture if you prefer. Turn the stove to low heat. As you can see, I keep the flame super low so it doesn't go out. Give it a quick oiling. Getting the right heat is crucial for making Japanese pancakes. If it's too high, the pancakes will puff up fast but also deflate just as quickly once you take them out of the pan. Now gently squeeze the batter onto the preheated skillet. You'll notice it holds its shape and doesn't spread out. That's your meringue flexing its muscles,  showing it’s whipped to perfection! Let's pick up the pace and jump ahead. Add a few drops of water to the pan. This will create steam to help the pancakes stay moist. Cover with a lid and cook for 7 to 10 minutes. It should cook very low and slow. Try not to lift the lid. Nice job! Now let's flip these bad boys without making a mess. Honestly, I'm a bit nervous—I’ve had some epic fails before. If you like my video, don't forget to subscribe. Just under a million subscribers to get to a million! So far, so good. Let's toss in a few more drops of water, slap a lid on it, and let it cook for another 5 minutes or so. Getting pancakes fluffy takes a bit of effort. I had a few flops before nailing it, but even when they didn’t look perfect, they were still soft, tender, and tasty. From my experience, the secret to fluffy pancakes is whipping the meringue just right and cooking on low heat. Thanks for watching! See you later."}
{"Q3xg35pcLyo": "(optimistic music) (grunting) - Hey everybody, it's Natasha\nof natashaskitchen.com and today I'm gonna teach you how we make our all-time\nfavorite bruschetta. That's how they pronounce\nit in Italian, I hope. (laughs) Anyway, this is a crowd-pleasing appetizer and wait 'til you see what\nwe put on top of these at the very end. Aw, it's so good. (giggling) Okay I'm hungry, let's get started. We'll start with six medium Roma tomatoes or about one 1/2 pounds and if you have access\nto homegrown tomatoes, that's even better. Remove the cores, then dice\nup all of your tomatoes. We love using our favorite\nfood chopper for this. It makes tomato bruschetta so easy. I'll leave a link to\nthis tool in the notes. Once your tomatoes are all chopped up, you'll wanna drain off any excess liquid. Transfer your tomatoes\nto a medium mixing bowl and now we're gonna get\nstarted on the fresh basil. Because this has so few ingredients, getting the best ingredients\nis really important, so you'll wanna use fresh basil. Pluck off one third cup\nof fresh basil leaves. Because basil is such a delicate herb, the way you slice it is important so you don't crush the basil. Stack the leaves, then roll them up. Now use a sharp knife to thinly slice or chiffonade the basil into thin ribbons. Add your chopped basil to the tomatoes. (upbeat music) Now, onto the garlic which adds amazing flavor to bruschetta. Finely mince about five cloves of garlic and you can add the garlic to taste. (upbeat music) And before we forget,\nyou'll wanna set aside about one garlic cloves\nworth of minced garlic. Transfer that to a small bowl with three tablespoons of\nextra virgin olive oil. We'll need that for later. Add the rest of the chopped\ngarlic to your tomato mixture. We're gonna finish off that tomato mixture with two tablespoons of\nextra virgin olive oil, one tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, half a teaspoon of salt and a quarter teaspoon of black pepper. Stir that together to combine. We're gonna set that aside to marinate for about 15 to 30 minutes and, oh, does this mixture smell so good. (upbeat music) Meanwhile preheat your oven\nto 400 degrees Fahrenheit with the rack in the center of the oven. You'll need one, long baguette and this happens to be a French baguette. Cut that into half inch thick slices and I like to cut them diagonally for a prettier presentation. Now arrange the toast on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Now, remember that olive oil that we infused with fresh, minced garlic? We're gonna brush that on\nboth sides of the toasts. Now, flip 'em over and repeat. You'll wanna use up all of\nthat garlic-infused olive oil. Once those are all oiled up, you'll wanna top each\ntoast with a little bit of shredded Parmesan cheese and I'm using about one third to one\nhalf cup total cheese. (giggling) Now, bake at 400 degrees\nFahrenheit for about five minutes, then increase the heat\nto broil on high heat for one to two minutes or until\nthe edges are golden brown. Oh, it is time for the taste test and when I'm serving these\nfor a gathering or party, I like to put them on a platter and just keep the tomato part and the bread separate. This way the breads stay extra crisp and people can just build their own. Okay, 'cause once you have\nthat topping on there, you'll wanna eat it\npretty quickly afterwards. 'Cause it'll soften up the bread. Ah, and these are so crisp. All right, I'm excited\nand I'm gonna show you my favorite way to build these. These bruschetta or bruschetta. So, we're gonna make a few of 'em. Okay. So, first pile it high\nwith this tomato mixture. This adds so much great flavor. Love the freshness of tomatoes and, when they're in\nseason, this is even better. So, you have to try this\nwith fresh tomatoes. And one more. Again, lots of tomatoes. Pile 'em high. Now for just a little extra topping, you can either drizzle them with some extra virgin olive oil. So, we'll do one of those\nwith oil, just a little bit. It adds that fresh olive oil flavor and my personal favorite\nand this is so good. This is something that I\nlearned from a restaurant that we went to and we\nordered their bruschetta and it was just life-changing. (laughs) This recipe's actually based on that. So, this is our balsamic glaze. We have a really easy\nhomemade version of this or you can use a store-bought one. But you can just drizzle\na little bit over the top as a garnish and it adds\nreally great flavor. Okay, so we're gonna do this taste test 'cause I can not wait any longer. I'm gonna go the one with the balsamic,\nmy favorite first. (hums) This is so delicious. (giggles) I love how that Parmesan cheese adds that little salty bite to the toast and they are so crispy on the outside, but still soft on the inside and then that tomato topping\nwith the fresh basil. It has this punch of\ngarlic which is so nice. But it's mellowed out\nbecause it's been sitting and marinating for a little bit. This is amazing, totally\nrestaurant quality. It feels like you're sitting\nin an Italian bistro. Do they have bistros in Italy? I don't know. (laughs) It's good. I hope you guys find this to be a new favorite for you and I have to taste test the other one because I have to. I have to tell you how\nit tastes, you know? Okay. (humming) So crunchy. Really, really good. Get the best quality\nolive oil you can find. 'Cause this is so simple,\nsimple ingredients. So, when you can get the best ingredients, it makes all the difference. I hope these become a new favorite for you and we'll see you in our next video. Yeah, I'm gonna come into\nthe scene with my mitten. My mitten. (clapping)\nOkay. Oh. (chuckling) Hello. (laughs) Hello. (laughing) Nope, nope, let's do one more. (laughs) That looks really ugly. I kind of forgot to arrange them. (sighs) (laughs)"}
{"dYgRHTSdOGE": "so there's a number of things that we go out and order and everything to make and you might think well i don't even know if i can make that at home well the answer with this is you can it's easier than you think and it might just be one of the greatest things that you ever make [Music] okay so we're making one of my favorite things of all time fresh spring rolls not the fried kind now obviously we know the crunchy ones with vegetables and maybe a little bit of meat whatever these are the ones that are translucent you can see a little bit of the shrimp peeking through or sometimes there's pork or whatever and then there's rice noodles it's crunchy it's sweet it's a little salty there's just everything you want and obviously you can't forget the peanut sauce but another thing you can't forget is today's sponsor which is spam yes spam one of the most chef revered canned products of all time you might be thinking josh well wait you're sponsored by spam why uh well first off this goes way back for me i'm talking like down to learning about cooking learning about chefs and what they do and working with chefs many of my chef friends love this ingredient because it is so versatile you can see it you could base it you could do so much with it and here they are knock that off the bucket list we're sponsored by spam so really we have two recipes here we have a traditional one and then we have a little surprise from our friends at spam so with all that said let's make this shall we now the actual making and rolling of spring rolls doesn't really require much effort or time but we first have to make all the components first let's talk rice vermicelli noodles you can get these at asian markets or maybe if your local grocer is a homie you might be able to get it there too you'll need about five to six ounces of these prepare them according to the package directions these just say to boil for about six minutes now once they're done plunge them in an ice water bath until completely cold this feels nice then rinse them thoroughly that's it now let's make the peanut sauce that's peanut sauce yanaiste so you just start with half a cup or 148 grams of hoisin sauce a quarter cup or 60 grams of smooth peanut butter 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of sambal or any sort of spicy you like 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of rice vinegar this is a fancy yuzu rice vinegar 2 cloves of grated garlic and finally thin it out with a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of warm water whisk that together and then drink the entire thing just kidding that would probably not probably wouldn't feel great it's pretty intense uh next up is gonna be fried crispy shallots and they're very easy just get yourself about six to eight shallots cut their tops off and peel them but leaving them whole then i would really recommend using a mandolin over a knife and slice them a little thinner than a quarter of an inch once you have all your slices get a deep pan like a cast iron skillet and fill it up with at least one and a half inches of oil add your shallot in yes while it's cold then place it over medium high heat and while that's coming up you're going to constantly stir them with a pair of chopsticks you'll notice that they start to bubble and then fry and just keep stirring and frying you'll know they're almost done once they begin to stop bubbling so much and they start to color please understand these will color very fast and burn very quickly if you don't pay attention once the bubbling begins to subside and they're almost to a nice golden brown immediately remove them and drain them on a paper towel you pull them a little bit before because they will continue to brown after pulled out of the oil oh my gosh it's time for papa learning corner you know the reason why that matters is it's called heat carryover that's because heat continues to stay after you remove it from a hot area it's not like it just instantly goes away let this cool completely and you have crunchy shallots now these won't be used in the traditional shrimp one but the way that i like to plate up the peanut sauce is i like to take a small handful of toasted peanuts and a small handful of your crispy shallots place them in a bag and beat them lovingly with a mallet or a pot until you get a nice little crumble and i like to sprinkle that on top of my peanut sauce when serving but we're getting ahead of ourselves here okay so we have the majority of our components let's start with a traditional shrimp spring roll fill a medium sized pot with water place it on your stove and bring it to a boil optionally you can add aromatics like shallot or ginger like i did here once it comes to a boil drop in one pound of peeled and deveined shrimp cover with the lid and turn the heat off and let them poach for three to four minutes then remove them and immediately drop them into an ice water bath to cool and that's it you have beautifully poached shrimp now to assemble our shrimp spring roll first get a medium-sized bowl add in one to two julienne carrots i used a julienne peeler by the way for this one ew josh is cheating when yeah well you know what it was faster all right one to two thai chilies that have been thinly sliced a quarter cup or five grams of torn mint a quarter cup or five grams of torn cilantro and a quarter cup or six grams of torn thai basil hit that with the zest of one lime and toss together to combine now we're ready to assemble get some round rice paper sheets these are also available at asian markets also have a link in the description fill a large bowl with enough warm water to submerge it in and well submerge one rice paper sheet for about two to three seconds or until it becomes a little bit malleable pull it out place it on a cutting board add a few leaves of lettuce of your choice these are little baby boston leaves followed by your vermicelli noodles i mean look at those dangly boys some of your carrot herb salad followed by more lettuce and of course your poached shrimp which by the way have been sliced in half like so arrange your shrimp as you like to make a nice little design then fold the right side over then the left side over and well roll it all the way up it's kind of like a rice paper burrito in a way place it to the side and then repeat with the rest of your shrimp ones and you have a beautiful shrimp spring roll one of my favorite things about spring rolls you can do this this is the true original glizzy there was no other glizzy until this homemade spring rolls extremely easy but without further ado a little dunkaroo oh my [ __ ] fell out go back in here funny man stop looking at me vikram maybe it's because it has everything that i want in it but to me this is the perfect spring roll traditional it's relaxed it's great for when it's hot outside but you can also eat this during the winter and be perfectly happy all the flavors match beautifully one thing that i would note is when you make it yourself i mean you are essentially probably going to make the best spring roll you've ever had because you're putting everything that you want in it now tradition is great but what if we made a little bit of a upgraded version if you will this one's for the chefs get yourself one spam classic can remove your spam and cut it into quarter inch slices like so then cut those slices in half to get some nice little rectangles get yourself a medium sized pan heat it over medium high heat with enough oil to coat the bottom and once that's ripping hot add your spam in batches to avoid overcrowding and sear for about two minutes or till beautifully seared and crispy give it a flip and sear for an additional two minutes now another thing you can do is brush it with some hoisin sauce after you flipped it and brulee it with a kitchen torch to get a little bit of a glaze optional but uh recommended in a small bowl add 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated sugar and whisk in 1 tablespoon or 15 milliliters of hot water whisk that until mostly dissolved then add 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of lime juice and 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of fish sauce whisk it together and adjust acidity and sweetness if needed i know i have more than three here that's because today the grocery store decided to only supply tiny little baby ugly garlic followed by two thai chilies that have been very thinly sliced whistled together and you've got a nakcham dressing now we're gonna assemble this similarly but with one small change get yourself one cucumber cut off the ends and cut it in half then using a mandolin or a sharp knife shave it into nice little ribbons like so almost like a pappardelle pasta now to assemble this it's very similar rehydrate one of your rice papers place it on your cutting board and evenly shingle four ribbons across the center of your rice paper keep them nice and uniform like this and press them down so that they stick then add your lettuce and your vermicelli noodles that look like i don't know like little intestines for some reason uh sorry that's gross your carrot herb salad from earlier then lightly dress those noodles in your nacho dressing more lettuce a generous handful of your fried shallots i mean look at that that alone would be a perfect roll add your seared and glazed spam i cut this one in half again so that it would fit a little better fold the right side over then the left side and yet again starting from the bottom roll all the way up and around to create the most beautiful almost green glizzy spring roll you know this looks so beautiful on the outside i think we need to get ourselves a little cross section and i mean other than that annoying noodle that's sticking right there that is one of the most beautiful cross sections i think i've ever seen now let's give these a little taste test we have the spam enhanced ultra glizzy goblin spring roll now this kind of has a little bit of reminiscence to the asian hawaiian combo of the spam misubi but now we've got sort of a vietnamese sort of combo going on with the spam [Music] sauce spam your chewing the fresh nakcham hits you've got the lettuce and then that salty fatty rich whippy and glazed spam hits you i mean i don't think you could make a better version of this there is a pork version of a spring roll this out does that by a million and billion petrillion is that a word turn number not a is that a number i don't know the difference i don't know different numbers but really whether you're more traditional you know you want the traditional shrimp lettuce a little bit of carrot nothing else cool then this is your your way to go but if you want to go on a roller coaster to flavor town then spam spring roll this peanut sauce is so good i don't have many words this is just so good honestly the spam one has more of an asian taste to it than this thank you for letting us eat jelly thank you but do you want to know what else is a green glizzy these are just making less and less sense every day [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made spring rolls first off humongous thank you and shout out to spam for sponsoring this video and for making these spring rolls one of the most delicious spring rolls i think i've ever made and you even saw vikram and tj both of them actually liked the spam one more we're really upping what we consider tradition and i think it's just one of those things you see respect being paid but you also bring in a new thing to sort of a traditional flavor and now you have these two combos that then make something greater than the sum of its parts kind of like how spam misubi was invented so i don't know if we invented a new spring roll but if we did hey remember the josh weissman coin and if you use it that'll be about 300 billion dollars so just just you know you could just keep a jug of this peanut sauce in your refrigerator and just maybe if you walk by the fridge you know pop the top take a little sip that's gross maybe not that but if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time

{"LKuF1DTyVGY": "[Music] making your own Samo rups at home is just so easy hey friends this is a very easy recipe that yields very crispy samosas that you can do on any day of the week and you and your family will definitely enjoy for this recipe measure four cups all purpose flour into this [Music] bowl into the bowl a teaspoon koser salt half a teaspoon sugar whisk everything together into the bowl I'm going to add one cup water but I'm going to start with a half of it and then add as needed then with a spatula I'm going to bring this together to start forming a dough [Music] we are looking for a dough here with the same consistency as a [Music] chapati [Music] we'll move this to a d mat and continue working on it incorporate all the flour here for me this dough doesn't need any more water although it feels like it's a little hard but remember it's going to continue absorbing the water that you have used but always don't shy away to add a little few drops of water if you feel like you need it now this door is almost there as you can see it's almost springing back it needs some rest just finish this with a touch of olive oil maybe a teaspoon now shap this dough in into a bowl give it a good rest about half an hour wrap it leave it alone this dough is all rested so feels very nice and soft so now I'm going to roll this into a long log and then cut it into pieces see how smooth it's become it's absorbed all the moisture that was in it all the water and this is ready to be rolled so cut this two into a half and then half into halves and then continue cutting a half now cut these pieces into another half and then I'm going to form them into small balls like so and then I'll continue this process process until all these are cut into halves and shaped into small balls and then have them rest I'm all done rolling this into these small balls so 1 2 3 4 five about 15 pieces because I had to readjust and make them about fairly same size now I'll bring the plastic wrap back have them rest for about 10 minutes also now these dough balls look all rested you can just see how they springing back so divide them into five Lots then I'm going to find a spot to keep them for our next part I need a rolling pin some extra flour here for dusting a brush and some olive oil dust the mat here with a touch of flour take one of these balls just spread it a tiny bit some flour using a rolling pin just make a small circle probably just about maybe 5 in or so just like so I'll put it aside one more dust It and Roll to the same size as the other one now on to the last one just roll it just like the other ones boom that's done so now I'll go back to the fast one late right here spread some olive oil right on top and then just just spread it dust with flour lay one of these right on top repeat some oil brush dust with flour lay one more right on top and then keep doing this repeating the process so remember we are doing this in batches of five it going to be easier to work with so they'll lay the last one right here on top then just make sure that they all lined up just fail the lined up and then move this put it aside just cover with some plastic wrap take one more do the same process some oil brush flour top with one more and then continue until they are all done now dust the mat with some fresh flour here and then bring the fastest tuck some flour ad dusting on top Now using my mat as a guide I'm going to roll one of these tacks into about 14 in uh Pizza size so just make sure that they are all stuck together spread some flour right on top and then I'll start rolling this into a circle about 14 in my cast iron is about 15 in also so I'll need some allowance so that's Loosely about 14 in wide this will go onto a hot cast iron just carefully lay it so it snuggly fits and let this cook for low medium until it just slightly Bubbles and then you want to give it a turn now once the slight bubble starts to here pinch it in one corner give it just a turn you can help it with a spatula just press it all around pinch it again so this is a quick process at this point you want to be careful you don't want to cook it all the way you're not looking for any color and this for me is all done so take one more stack dust some flour and and repeat the [Music] process and let's quickly as you put it on this is basically done now bring the wraps onto a work table and all we want to do now is just peel them just so carefully so you want to get to one end and then just peel this off just carefully lay it right on top keep repeating the process until you get these very thin sheets of dough just like so so you want to be careful with this you want to work very fast at this stage because they tend to dry out just so quickly because of how thin they are so get all these so keep peeling this beautifully thin and delicate shets I'm going to separate this into a few batches here again so always be careful with them take this so all I want to do with this just trim the rough in edges here with a sharp knife I don't have to be exact if you're looking for perfect circles you can do that I don't need to because eventually this will form into triangles this makes perfect chips you can fry those now go into the rough middle of this cut it all the way and then turn them just carefully stack them again then go into quarters and you end up with these beautiful triangles I'll put this aside and this cut into thirs then and stick this together and you have an idea you get those more like Spring Row wraps so I'll go ahead and finish them all so boom all done now I have some prepared Samosa mix here this is all beef mildly spice I always make a big lot and then have it in the freezer so I def roasted this and it's ready to go check out the recipe on how to do this on my channel I'll will share it on top somewhere this is very popular with my clients now this aside for a second prepare the paste about 2 tbspoon all Peppers flour just a touch of water it really doesn't matter you can use egg wash too that's all set all you need is just a sort of a rough paste this will be our glue now pick up one of these triangle all I want to do is just bring it all the way almost close to the center and then with a brush get some of this paste just a little bit not too much and then just aach in the inside and then I'm going to bring the other corner here just lay it right on top of this one and then lift the holding up and then you got this nice pocket that you can fill with whatever you filling your samosas with in our case we have this beef so this goes back onto our pen so repeat repeat until I'm all done with this batch so one more paste bring this wrap it you get a pocket you filling get it in get this if it seems like it's opening at the bottom you can always readjust so get this and relign it so the key is to make sure that you have a tight seal so the oil doesn't get in so get the bigger flap get the paste bring all the way again another triangle now bring the spring roll style and then all I want to do with this just get one corner here bring it make a pocket by lining all these and just as the other ones get the Samosa mix and then you got that r rough triangle I'll pick another one so you want to pick one corner of this very delicate flap bring it all the way to this side like so and then fold it over and then lift this up so some o mix this one you can actually just lay it at the bottom and then just roll it over along the lines and then this remaining flap just paste it with your glue and you get that a triangle so I'll finish the [Music] rest so now fry this into a 350 F oil ready to [Music] enjoy this takes just about 3 minutes to four all you're looking here is just for the color and just reheat the [Music] filling when I make this reminds me of street food in Kenya especially Mombasa Nairobi all major Urban centers you'll find these samosas fried all across and they're very delicious once you satisfied with the color take them off just listen to that very crispy go in with the last batch so there you go all done frying [Music] so friends there you have it a recipe that you can do on any day of the week and you and your family will definitely enjoy I occasionally like to use this recipe although I can admit I like like to buy uh my wraps ready prepared

{"PvYv3y7TYtI": "- Hey, I'm John Kanell.\nToday on \"Preppy Kitchen\" we're making a quick and\neasy, super creamy hummus, so let's get started. The best way to cook your hummus is gonna be from chickpeas\nyou cook at home, but if you want to use canned chickpeas, I have a great hack for you. The problem with canned\nchickpeas is they've been cooked, but they still have\nthose tough fibrous skins on the outside of the peas. So we're gonna help dislodge those and make a delicious, creamy hummus. Open your can and we're gonna\ndrain and rinse these guys. Pop these into a small pot.\nThis step is totally optional. If you wanna skip it, skip\nahead to the mark below. Your hummus will still be delicious, just slightly less creamy. That chickpea water is called aquafaba, and if you want, you can reserve it to use in a ton of different recipes. It adds fluffiness and structure. You could whip it up like a meringue, use it in pancakes or pizza\ndough, the list goes on. I, however, I'm not doing that today. Now we're gonna cover this\nwith two inches of water and simmer for 20 minutes\nuntil the skin starts floating. Then we can scoop all that skin off and have only those tender chickpeas left. All those skins have come to the top and they could be discarded. They're just not very soft, so they don't break up\nin the food processor. Now we can drain and rinse our chickpeas, grab our food processor, and get to work. To the bowl of my food processor, I'm adding my drained chickpeas. I'm also gonna add a quarter\ncup of smooth tahini, but make sure you mix it really well. It definitely separates just\nlike natural peanut butter, and you don't want to have\ntoo much oil or not enough, so give it a nice mix. Tahini has sesame seeds and\nit gives you a lovely flavor. By the way, if you're wondering like, oh, why don't we just cook\nthe chickpeas at home? You definitely could. It just makes this a planned ahead recipe, because to cook chickpeas, it's\nthree to four hours on high, or six to eight hours on low. My mom always prefers to cook them on low, which means you're gonna make\nthat a day ahead basically. Hummus actually originated\nin ancient Egypt and spread throughout the Mediterranean. It's popular worldwide because it's such a delicious snack. It goes with everything, and\nthere's tons of variety too. This is gonna be your blank canvas hummus. You can add anything to it. It's delicious as is, but it's a totally amazing\nvehicle for different flavors. And now you need three to four tablespoons of fresh lemon juice so let's squeeze that into a bowl. And by the way, if you liked my videos, go ahead and hit that subscribe button. There's two new recipes every single week. Lots of shorts and all\nwith something delicious on the horizon. Add that lemon juice\nin. One, two, and three. I'm actually gonna add four in. There we go. For some extra flavor, I'm\nadding a clove of garlic. You could add more than one clove. You could roast the garlic, and really, you could add so\nmany different flavors in here. One nice clove. For some contrast, I'm adding\nhalf a teaspoon of salt. You could add more if\nyou like it extra salty, and half a teaspoon of cumin. When I was in my twenties, my go to appetizer whenever\nI had people over was hummus. And I would make a batch from scratch, but I would add in like\ntwo to three jalapenos and a giant fistful of cilantro. (John smacks lips) So good. Just add it in the food processor kind of towards the end. It'll chop up into little\npieces and be spicy and amazing. Any herb will work well in this though. Get it started and let the\nfood processor do the work. Your mixer is gonna be\nworking for a while, so you can walk away and come\nback or keep an eye on it, it's up to you. You do want to have some ice water on hand because we'll be drizzling\nin two tablespoons in a few minutes. And by the way, if you're wondering where the word hummus comes from, it means chickpea in Arabic. Hmm. (processor whirring) This is a great time\nto scrape the bowl down because it's looking fairly smooth, but there's nonsense all up\non this bowl, so pat it down. This is actually a great science lesson because even though all\nmy ingredients were cold, after this is done, the\nhummus itself is gonna be warm from all the kinetic\nenergy of that blade moving in the food processor. My hummus looks fairly smooth, so it's time to add in about two table... About two tablespoons of ice water. The ice water is gonna help\nthe ingredients emulsify, and we're adding water in the first place because the hummus is\npretty thick right now. If you wanted to, you\ncould add more lemon juice for a really lemony kick though. One and two. I'm gonna let the...\n(processor whirring) I'm gonna let the food processor run for about five minutes. It might seem like a lot, but you want that humus\nto be so nice and creamy. While your processor is running, think about whether you want this plain, if you wanna divide it in\nbatches and add extra flavors, or if you wanna like scavenge\nthe fridge for inspiration, the world is your oyster. (processor whirring) If you want more hummus, just\ndouble or triple this recipe. It is so easy as long\nas your food processor can handle the extra ingredients. Three minutes in, you're gonna\nwanna scrape the bowl down. Just tamp everything down. You can also look right in the middle and scooch away any liquid if\nthere's a little pool there. Add in one tablespoon of\nextra virgin olive oil. Let this mixer run and you're gonna notice it is actually pretty warm,\nall that kinetic energy. And just like that, our hummus is done. Now it's ready to garnish. Paprika, sumac, za'atar,\nroasted pine nuts, roasted garlic, more chickpeas. There are so many different\ntypes of garnishes you can do, and it's really whatever\nflavors you'd like to use. It really comes down to\nwhat you have on hand and what flavors you want to use. Today. I'm keeping it simple with some minced parsley and paprika. If stored in an airtight container, your hummus will last for\nup to a week in the fridge. You could use it in dips and spreads. It's great in falafels, and it's honestly\ndelicious by the spoonful. Garnish with a really nice olive oil add a sprinkle of paprika or sumac. Your hummus is officially ready to enjoy. Hmm, creamy and substantial with a lovely kiss of lemon and garlic. It is just about perfect. I hope you get a chance\nto make this recipe. And if you liked this video,\nhit that subscribe button.

is one of the easiest things to do at home you just have to be prepared who's ready to make the best guacamole the most important part of making a guacamole is choosing the right avocado what I choose today is avocado has from the state of mokan Mexico they taste better they're richer on Flavor in front of me I have the same avocado but on different stage I'm ripe perfect one and the over rpe I recommend you not to squeeze like want to get a bruise onto the avocado so just by looking at the color I can already tell which one is the best avocado out of the three we don't want to choose green we don't want to choose two dark brown another way of finding out if your avocados are on point is by the stem right here when you remove this part of the avocado if it's too yellow brown that means it's overripe so this is already no bueno the perfect one has to be kind of like a green with a little bit of yellow this is perfect the safest way to cut an avocado is choosing the right avocado if it's too green you're going to put more Force into the knife and you have more chances of you cutting yourself you want to use a bigger knife it will be easier for you to cut the avocado all the way around when cutting an avocado you're going to grab it from the bottom because it's wider and you can control it easier and you slice when you feel the seat you want to go around you moving the avocado you're not moving the knife that's it now you're going to remove the knife put it away and then twist and that's how you cut an avocado you see this brown part right here this is because somebody put their fingers into my avocado to know smash the avocado with your fingers now what you do with this you remove it with a little spoon that's it not a big deal now how you remove the seat bigger knife slam it a little bit just to cut the seat you twist Right comes out now with this finger you kind of push it and it comes off so let's do our second avocado grab it from the bottom slice twist then just twist beautiful avocado bend it a little bit and then you twist you push it okay now I'm going to dice the avocado for my guacamole and for for this I'm going to need a smaller knife now I kind of leave like a maybe almost an inch free so I'm going to cut it in half through here you need do four I like to pre- dice my avocado because it will save you energy when you smash it cuz you're going to need a lot of energy to eat it the best trick to avoiding cutting your hand is take your time do it slowly if you do it hard or you use so much force you probably cut really deep now I'm going to remove this part right here cuz we don't want this on my guacamole so now I'm want to scoop the avocado out of the shell and here is my avocado dice for my guacamole let's move to dicing our vegetables to make guacamole you need six ingredients avocado cilantro onions sarano tomatoes lime I'm going to start with the onion remove the bottom part the top part cut it in half I'm removing these parts I'm going to use only half onion I'm going to hold it from Where the Heart of the onion is and dice it from the end of the onion small dices the smaller the easier to smash CU I want the onion to be all over the guacamole not only on just little parts of the guacamole I'm not slicing all the way in I kind of want to leave this in without touching it so it will hold the onion it will be easier to slice so don't cut all the way through just halfway that's it and then just slice it a little bit so now I'm going to add it into the Mah why I choose a sarano because I'm Mexican it's a beautiful spice without being too overpowering you can make it even spicier by Smashing them and now I'm going to dice this with entire seats because I want this to be nice and spicy you can remove the seeds no problem that's all up to you if you want to find out how spicy us Serano is smell it w if you got a strong smell that means it's spicy also on the sarano if you see like a little scratch on the skin that means it's going to be spicier this is okay because it's nice and smooth so now I have my DIC white onions DIC Sano pepper and I'm going to add a little bit of lime so you see the Skins between this one and that one guess which one is going to be more juicy the smoother now if you want to get more juice out of this one you're just going to smash it like that and it will be easier to squeeze now I'm going to squeeze some of it here don't do all the line because you don't know how acid is going to turns now I'm going to do some cilantro to get rid of the bottom part I like to use the stum of the cilantro it's better and Rich going to put it here it's always good to save some for garnish now I'm going to D some Tomatoes I'm using plum because they're nice and firm and I'm going to add the tomatoes into the end cuz I want that to be chunks so I'm not going to smash this I'm only going to use the outside of the Tomato I'm removing the inside of the Tomato this will make your wacamole liquidly we want big chunks cuz I want to see the tomatoes in it I'm going to add the tomatoes later WR so my ingredients are ready let's Mash all these ingredients together first I'm going to tell you about my friend right here Mah and aote Mexican model and pesel it brings the flavor out of the sarano the onions the cilantro and the lime is stronger if you don't have this at home get yourself a model pesel and if you don't have a m peso get yourself a bowl smash it with a wooden spoon dice the ingredients a little bit thinner it will make it easier for you to smash now I'm going to smash my onions sarano and cilantro I want the flavors to come out and also when I mix it with the avocado you won't find chunks of sarano or chunks of onion so what I'm doing here I'm making this into a little paste so look at this it's almost ready it's like I'm making a salsa now when we mix this with the avocado the flavor is going to be even you might find some brown little pieces it's okay to eat it I rather don't serve it because I'm a professional so we have the avocado there I'm going to do a little bit of salt and now little bit more smashing and look how easy it is and this is why we dice our avocado this makes me happy food alone makes me happy I don't see the onions I don't see the sanos CU they just got married we don't want to over smash we're not making puree we're making guacamole guacamole should be creamier and chunky now I'm going to add some of these lovely Tomatoes The reason why I add tomatoes last because tomatoes release water oh my gosh look this is what a perfect guacamole looks like now before you put it on a plate or serve it taste it it need salt and it needs a little more lime gosh can't believe I get paid to do this okay second shot so good so good my guacamole it's ready so normally in Mexico we serve the guacamole in the Mah the rock is cold so you will keep the guacamole fresher for a longer period of time I'm going to garish it with a little bit of queso fresco this is optional so this adds like a saltiness element to my guacamole which is always good there's some chips that are very fragile like my heart I'm going to use corn tortilla chips they need to be strong guacamole it's normally heavier so you need something that holds that really well and these tortillas are my favorite and we save some cilantro right and there is the perfect guacamole right in your kitchen now to my favorite part eating the guacamole m H I don't feel any chunks of onions I don't feel any chunks of sarano peppers it's just creamy chunky delicious she need a beer now maybe two how easy was this process it was very easy my daughter Ella and Elena she's eight and six they already know how to make guacamole it's very simple the key is the avocado choose the right avocado"}
{"tj7HF_iMO5U": "- Hey guys, it's Yumna\nfrom Feel Good Foodie. Today, I'm going to teach you how I make my traditional\nLebanese tabbouleh salad, just the way my mom\ntaught me how to make it. Tabbouleh is a vegan,\nhealthy, Mediterranean salad, that's made up of parsley, tomatoes, mint, and burghul, which is also known as bulgur wheat. It's all finally chopped together then tossed in a very simple vinegarette that's made up of olive\noil and lemon juice. This is a very popular\nsalad in the Middle East, and it's becoming more and\nmore mainstream in the US, but I'm gonna teach you how to make it just a\nlittle bit more authentic with a couple of tips from my kitchen. It's only a handful of ingredients, but it's a real treat for your taste buds. You'll need fresh parsley, I have about two bunches here. When you chop it up, you want it to be about two\ncups of chopped parsley. We've got tomatoes, lemons, bulgur, some green onions, some mint, and olive oil, salt, and pepper. Let's get started. We're going to start with the vinegarette. Traditionally, when you make the salad in Lebanon, you use a fine bulgur, so you can see this is super fine, and it almost looks like sugar, kinda the consistency that you want. In grocery stores, you'll find it numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, you want fine bulgur, which is number 1. This is what you want, and normally, the way you would cook this, to use it, just put it in some water, and it'll absorb the\nwater and be ready to use. What I like to do instead is add lemon juice and olive oil right to the burgul and\nlet that get absorbed. We'll add about three\ntablespoons of lemon juice, and a third of a cup of olive oil, and I'll just use a fork\nto whisk it all together. What's gonna happen is, after about 10, 15 minutes, the bulgur is going to absorb all that lemon juice and the olive oil, and that's going to be the base for the salad vinegarette. Now we'll get chopping, there's a lot of chopping here, and you might be tempted to use food a processor\nto chop all this parsley, but don't do it, chop it up, it's gonna be so much better, it's gonna look better, it's gonna taste better too. We've got a bunch of parsley here, and I'm gonna get chopping. (Yumna chopping parsley) Okay, so it's a lot of chopping, and it's very fine now, but this is the way\nit's made traditionally, so it's going to just\nhelp absorb everything, and the flavor is just\ngonna be so much better when it's chopped this finely. Okay. Now, we're gonna transfer this to a bowl. (Yumna transferring parsley) Next, we'll add some chopped mint. I like to put about three tablespoons, so fourth of a cup of mint, but this is optional, so you don't have to put that. Also some green onions, which are not optional. (Yumna laughing) When you're cutting the tomatoes, one thing you want to make sure of is that the tomatoes are not too liquidy. There's two ways to do that, one is to drain the liquid\nout of the tomatoes, and two is to just hollow\nout the inside of them. I prefer method two, it's a little bit faster. What I'll do is cut the\ntomatoes in quarters, then remove the inside, and then you're just ending up with the firmer part of the tomato, and this is where it's going to keep the salad from becoming too wet. This is what you end up with. (Yumna laughing) You're gonna end up with just the firmer part of the tomato, there's still lots of flavor there, lots of color, and this is the part that we wanna use. Don't throw this part out though, because you can use this for all kinds of recipes later on. Now that we're left with the\nfirmer part of the tomatoes, just going to finally chop these. We've got the tomatoes in here, and tomatoes are a different preference for different people, but you definitely want\nthem to be much less than the parsley, so you can kind of see in here, it's like a fourth of the\namount of the parsley. Now we're gonna go ahead and season with some salt and pepper. I put all the seasoning\nright on the tomatoes, because they absorb it the most, but just kind of eyeball it, some salt and some pepper. This mixture has only been sitting here for five minutes right now, but you can already see it's much thicker, but that's exactly what we're looking for. Now we're going to transfer\nthe burghul mixture to the tabbouleh. As you're mixing it, you'll notice that there's\nway more parsley than burghul, and that's very traditional\nof a Lebanese tabbouleh, you definitely want to\nsee more of the green and less of the white, it should just be kind of\nlittle speckles in there, of little bulgur wheat. Now, don't forget to do a little taste test for salt and pepper. It is tasting really good. I think I'll add a little\nbit more lemon juice to it. That's the beauty the salad, you can definitely add a touch more. I make the salad in the same bowl that I'm going to serve\nit in for less dishes. I'm just gonna go ahead\nand wipe this down. I kept a little extra tomatoes just to add it to the top for when it's time to serve it. Then I like to just add\na couple of lemon slices when I'm serving it, and there you have it, homemade traditional tabbouleh. (Yumna laughing) There you have it, traditional Lebanese tabbouleh salad. That's it, that's a very simple, quick\nrecipe that you can make that's full of flavor and\ntantalizing for your taste buds from all that fresh\nparsley, fresh tomatoes, and fresh lemon juice.

{"oCVOU-9BlPg": "the best part about practicing your knife skills is that you get to eat the results i mean let's just say for a moment that you combined one and a half pounds of vine ripe tomatoes conquested with one cup of peeled seeded and chopped cucumber one half cup each chopped red onion and diced red bell pepper one jalapeno seeded and minced one clove of garlic minced and one cup of tomato juice most of which you should have been able to get out of your con cassette now if you were to stir this up and serve it people would say gracious but that's a fine salsa you have there but what if you went further what if you added a quarter cup of extra virgin olive oil the juice of one lime two teaspoons each of balsamic vinegar and worcestershire sauce a teaspoon of kosher salt very nice half a teaspoon of cumin roasted and ground fine and a quarter teaspoon of black pepper let's say that you stirred that up nicely and say you moved about a cup and a half of that over to your friendly neighborhood blender for liquefying why thank you thing let's say you added that back into the bowl gave it a good stir maybe i refrigerated it for a few hours topped it with a nice basil chiffonade which we just happen to have and served it alongside a nice crunchy piece of bruschetta well gosh darn it you know you would have the andalusian classic gazpacho which oddly enough was originally defined as being simply a soup of bread and oil and and some garlic because back then of course there were no tomatoes in spain but there are now and i'm glad you"}

{"a83aEtc03tY": "Cinnamon rolls this good shouldn't even be possible. And yet, here we are. As a first step, we need to bloom our yeast. Right here, I have some active dry yeast, which I'm going to combine with some warm milk. Give it a quick whisk, and then let that sit for 10 minutes to make sure it foams up and is alive, just like this one here. Next, grab the bowl of your stand mixer and add in your flour, sugar, and salt, which we're going to quickly whisk before locking back into the stand mixer. Next, we'll combine a couple eggs as well as our yeast mixture into a bowl. Whoa, it made a perfect X. And then whisk this up until fully combined. Now, we'll add our egg mixture into our flour mixture. And then mix on medium until everything has formed into a dough. Scraping down the sides of your bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. When it's done, it'll look something like this. Not the best looking dough yet, but remember, we still have to add the best part, the butter. We'll bring our mixer back up to medium speed and add in our room temperature butter. Just one or two cubes at a time until each is fully incorporated. repeating this process until we've added all of it. Oh, and if you're not good at basketball, don't even try throwing your butter from a distance like I did. It's just going to make you look bad. The whole process of adding the butter will probably take you somewhere between 5 and 7 minutes. Once you can see in the dough that all that butter has been fully incorporated, we'll increase the mixer speed to six and let it mix until something called window panes start to form. It can be a little boring sitting there and waiting for your dough to mix, but if you listen carefully, you can often hear this really cool beat or rhythm in the dough. Sounds crazy, but for me it helps to pass the time a lot faster. Oh, I have to I have to stand like this so you can hear it. You're probably wondering what are window paints. Well, if you take your dough and then stretch it out, you can eventually start to see light through it without the dough breaking like a window. And that's when you know you're ready to move on. Butter the inside of a glass bowl all over to make sure your dough can't stick. Then do your best to shape your dough into a nice ball and drop it in. Cover this up in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 1 and a half to two hours or until it's doubled in size. After it's risen, remove the plastic wrap and punch down your dough. Give it a few more punches to help release some of that air. Then add back on your plastic wrap and place it in the fridge overnight. While our dough is in the fridge, sleeping and developing all kinds of flavor, we're going to make our filling. And that all starts with making my favorite, some brown butter. Making brown butter is easy. All you do is melt some butter down in a pot or pan and then stir constantly over medium heat, scraping down the sides of the pan until lots and lots of bubbles and then eventually a buttery foam begins to form. And a few seconds after that, the second you start seeing nice golden brown color, pour it out of the pan and off the heat into a room temperature bowl immediately. And in just seconds, you've got perfect brown butter. It's one of the single best ingredients you can use in the kitchen. Making brown butter is the first technique I can remember my grandmother teaching me when I was a kid trying to learn to cook. And ever since then, it's one of my favorites. With that brown butter, I'm going to add some cinnamon, some honey, a little fresh ground nutmeg, some salt, and some light brown sugar. And you'll want to let this sit and come to room temperature. But as always, I'm not going to make you wait. Fit your mixing bowl back into your stand mixer with a whisk attachment. And then mix on medium speed until you get a frosting like consistency that's doubled in size and lighter in color. You'll probably have to stop your mixer at some point during mixing and scrape off the bottom just to make sure everything gets fully incorporated as well. Otherwise, look at all those chunks of flavor we would have missed out on. This is going to be a real problem cuz I'm going to eat all of it before we move on to the next step. Once your mixture looks something like this, crack in one egg and mix on medium high until fully incorporated. It's good that the egg's in there now cuz it'll make me stop eating so much of it. After doing that second mix with the egg, it'll start to look a lot like a frosting. At which point, we can let it go rest at room temperature while we bring back in our happy and well-rested dough. Flour your work surface as well as the top of the dough. Then use a rolling pin and really whatever method you want to roll it into a 12x6in rectangle. A few fun facts about cinnamon rolls while I roll this out. First, cinnamon rolls were invented by accident. And second, cinnamon was once more valuable than gold. So, the early cinnamon rolls would have been pretty fancy. Once you're happy with your rectangle, dust off any remaining flour and then bring back in that filling from earlier and put it right down into the center. Spread the filling across your dough in a nice even layer. And try to have fun with this step. It's a beautifully satisfying part of the cinnamon roll making process. This step here makes me feel like some kind of painter or artist, and I feel like I could do it for hours without getting bored. Make sure you leave one strip of dough on the area closest to you with no frosting. About a/2 in or inch in length. To roll it into an actual cinnamon roll, I'll start by folding in the part closest to me. And then just roll it as cleanly and evenly into a log as you can. I know it's in an awkward spot on my cutting board here, but I'm not going to move it yet. First, I'm going to trim off the ends because unless you were able to roll your dough flat into a truly perfect rectangle earlier, the ends will always look uneven like this. Once I've trimmed both of the ends, I'll roll it onto some parchment paper. Roll it up nice and tight in plastic wrap and then place this carefully in the freezer for at least 20 minutes. Well, okay. Too many dino nuggets. Luckily, like always, I've already got one cold, so you don't have to wait. We're almost there. Remove the plastic wrap and parchment paper from your cinnamon roll. And then using the sharpest, thinnest knife you have, cut through the center. Hopefully, you've got a cross-section that looks just as good as this one. And from there, cut them into 10 of the most even pieces you can possibly get. Beautiful. That's perfect. And look, I got a little snack. Remember also that the more evenly you cut them, the more evenly they're going to cook in the oven. Now, spray your baking dish with cooking spray. Then add in a piece of parchment paper and spread out all your cinnamon rolls, giving them as much space possible between each other. Just pretend they don't like each other. Cover these up with plastic wrap and let them proof at room temperature for one and a half hours or until they've doubled in size. Now, we're going to put one spoonful of heavy cream on each of the risen cinnamon rolls. We do this because the cream seeps into the dough as it bakes and keeps the bottoms extra soft, which gives you that beautiful bakery level texture. It's sort of similar to how you base your turkey or soak your French toast in custard. The only reason you'd ever skip this step is if you wanted to eat a dry cinnamon roll. These are finally ready to go into the oven to bake. Pull them out once they've hit an internal temperature of 185 to 190° F. And then let them cool for at least 30 minutes. As tempting as it might be to eat them right now. And if you ever do get tempted, just remember we still have to make our frosting. But even before that, we're going to make a quick topping that is an absolute cinnamon roll game changer. And I promise we're going to finish this and the frosting before they're cooled down anyway. So, this works out perfectly. Here, we're making candied walnuts where you melt down a bit of butter with some brown sugar as well as a tiny pinch of salt. All we're doing here is throwing together a quick simple caramel over medium low heat. And the reason I think this is such an important part of the cinnamon roll recipe is because it creates this amazing crunchy texture that balances out against that soft gooiness of the cinnamon rolls. Once you're happy with the color and consistency of your caramel, toss in your walnuts or any nut of your choice and mix fully until they're evenly coated. Then place them on a parchment line baking sheet. And remember, if you get any clumps like this, don't worry cuz you can always crush this up more later. My special finishing touch on these is a little bit of lemon zest. That little touch of acidity will also help to balance out your cinnamon rolls. To make our frosting, we'll add a block of cream cheese, then some room temperature butter, and then beat this with a paddle attachment for about a minute or until light and fluffy. Once it looks something like this, add in your powdered sugar and continue to mix until that's fully incorporated, too, scraping down the sides of your mixing bowl as needed. Finally, we'll add in some milk, cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice. And then mix this once more until everything is fully combined. Once again, using that spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl if you need to. It's time. First order of business, no grandma, no rules. I never used to be allowed to do that. Real quick, I'm just going to do a rough chop of all the candied walnuts. I personally prefer if there's a good mix of some larger chunks and some small ones. And after all the waiting, it's time to put on our frosting. My method here is to start by putting a nice dollop of frosting on each one just to make sure I treat them all the same. And then I'll use my offset spatula to push some of that frosting around so I can actually see those spirals. You need to be able to see those after spending so much time making them. To finish, I'll sprinkle on my beautiful candied nuts because in my opinion, the cinnamon rolls just aren't complete without them. Let's see how we did here. The test of a good cinnamon roll. See if you can tell how well we did by my face. I could easily eat the whole tray, but then someone would have to roll me out of here."}
{"ZLULwy2cXVE": "I have many chocolate chip cookie recipes. I'm going to be honest with you. A few of them are worldrenowned. Except I finally one uped them. This is the best [music] chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever made. Something about the ratios that are in this cookie and the addition of a secret ingredient, which I'll show you, and all the different baking scenarios that I've tested, I've finally figured out what I think is consistently giving me the results I want [music] every single time. So, let's make it. We're going to start by mixing our cookie dough. No fancy equipment required. Then we'll chill the dough for optimal flavor and texture. Chocolate chip cookies. You can't have it without chocolate. 3 and 12 oz of dark chocolate. 70% 60% somewhere in that range. And then 3 oz of milk chocolate. I would prefer to do all dark, but I find that people enjoy it and find it more palatable when it's mixed with milk. So, you're going to rough chop your chocolate. Maybe two more passes. You can see how some of the chocolate from the chopping ends up like powderizing. I leave it in because then when you fold it into the dough, you get kind of this marble effect where the chocolate isn't just the little chunks of chocolate, but it's actually a part of the dough, too. Now that the chocolate's out of the way, we can make our dough. Half a cup of white sugar and 3/4 of a cup of light brown sugar. Break the brown sugar up and then whisk that together. Add a/2 cup of melted unsalted butter, not brown. And most people will tell you, you're not browning your butter in your cookies. This is not a good cookie recipe. Shut up. Every cookie recipe uses brown butter now. I don't know when this became a thing. Next, we're going to add one whole egg. Crack that in. Beat it quickly so that it emulsifies. We're going to add another emulsifier. A whole egg yolk. So, crack that carefully into a bowl so you don't pierce the yolk. Going to scoop it out with your hand like that. You can run it between your fingers so that the white falls below. And then the yolk goes in. Now, we're going to beat this yolk in. Again, make sure that that's fully incorporated, fully emulsified. You know there's an emulsion present because it's creamy. It's one consistent texture. There's no oil or butter resting on top. Typically, you'll see dry ingredients added to the flour and then mixed in. But then you can sometimes end up with uneven distribution. So, I actually add it to the liquid phase. A full teaspoon of kosher salt. If you use fine [music] sea salt, then do a/ teaspoon. A/ teaspoon of baking soda. Whisk that in. And then 2 tsps [music] of vanilla extract. So, I have 1 cup plus 6 tablespoons of allpurpose flour. We have all of our gram conversions on the website joshhismanisman.com. Links in the description for this specific one. Anyway, 1 cup plus 6 tablespoons of allpurpose flour. I'm going to add half of that first. And I'm just going to carefully stir that in using a rubber spatula. Once that's mostly incorporated, I'll add my other half. And I'll just [music] gently stir and fold that together. Really important that you don't overm mix this. I've got my secret ingredient. I know what you're thinking. Why are you putting chips in it? Guess what else is in the name? Chip. I actually didn't do it because of the play on words. I did it because it's good. Salty, sweet, crunchy contrast. And I realized that it made the cookies better. But it's a/2 cup of kettle cooked plain salt potato chips. And you're going to crush them by hand. As fine or as coarse as you want. I like to go to sort of a medium fine, somewhere in that range. Then you're going to add all your chocolate. And you're [music] going to fold that all together. Scoop under the dough. Fold the dough over to the center and press down. And you're just going to do that until everything's evenly incorporated. We're here to make it. Good night. I'm going to go get a new spatula. Cookie dough is done. Just cover this. Put this in the fridge overnight. When you bake them warm, they spread and they're going to get super thin. You're going to go, \"Josh, your recipe sucks.\" I'm telling you now, my primary recommendation is to put it in the fridge. Please, for God's sake, if I see another comment of someone saying, \"I put the cookies in and they spread so much and they're soed up.\" And then I go, \"Well, what'd you do?\" And they go, \"Well, I didn't put them in the fridge.\" Well, Jessica, you want to bake these from cold. But to make them easier to scoop, you can let them temper for about 10 to 15 minutes before scooping. But remember, cold dough equals a more even, less aggressive spread and a better bake. The one thing nobody seems to talk about is your cookie scoop size. It matters. It's going to change the end result of the cookie no matter what. If you have a really big size, then you have more surface area over center. If it's a really small one, you have the crispy exterior. There's a medium cookie scoop, one and a half to two tablespoons. Then there's a large cookie scoop, which is more like close to 3 tablespoons. And then there's one that's not even a cookie scoop, an ice cream scoop. And this is a heaping third cup of a scoop. Let's talk about the regular cookie scoop. Baking sheet. Obviously, parchment's going to go on here to help the parchment stick. A little spray of oil so that the parchment paper sticks. We have our chilled cookie dough. I always do a heaping scoop on these little cookie scoop, guys, just cuz they're so small. Pop it out. Boom. There you go. You can fit [music] more cookies per sheet than any other scoop on our list. Now, this smaller cookie scoop will do about 12 to a sheet and make a total of 20 to 24 cookies at that size. Each size you go up, you reduce the total yield by about 25% each step up. This will go into the oven at 350 Fahrenheit for eight to nine minutes. We're now on to the large. You're going to scoop the cookies just like you did before. Mound it mound it on top and pop that bad boy out. These are much bigger. Now you can only fit rows of two. To even further protect against mishaps, I do two one two one. Now our bake time changes. We're going to put this in the oven at 350 Fahrenheit. 10 to 11 minutes. What you're looking for, especially with these cookies, is a very specific look. You want golden around the edges and slightly underdone in the center. Yes, underdone. It's very important. This is my optimal recommended choice for all cookies. It's big enough to be substantial, but small enough that you can make many [music] of them. So, now that these have come out, we've flaky salted them. Now, we're going to let them sit on the parchment paper for 5 minutes. And then, got a thin spatula. Scrape underneath and transfer. Now we're going to let them cool the rest of the way. Now the final boss, the big dog. I like doing this for everything, parties, events, etc. But oftentimes I do it when it's just a small group of people so I can give them really big, substantial, [music] massive, fun cookies. So we have an ice cream scoop. Like I said, a heaping third cup. Boom. Dude, look at that monstrosity. Literally the size of a baseball. In fact, I have a recipe for uh cookies called baseball cookies in my second cookbook. Wow, look at that. Link in the description. Uh very good book. multi- New York Times bestseller. You should check it out. Very good. Anyway, as you might imagine, we have to reduce the amount of cookies on here. Two. Three cookies a tray. Can you fit more? You can try. We're going to zigzag [music] these. These are so big. I kind of lightly like to smush them down just a little. These are going to go in the oven at 350 Fahrenheit for 14 to 15 minutes. These take a fat minute. Same cues, golden edges, and a matte center. These we have to be more cautious when transferring because they're so big. Big dog. Now we have all of our associated cookie sizes. There are benefits to each. For the small, you get volume, which means they're ideal for parties, gatherings. If you need a lot of servings, one batch of cookies will make many more cookies. That's really the only reason. For the large, the benefit is they're just visually excessive. One cookie is enough for two people [music] easily. I like serving it this way just because it's like, bang, look at this. That is a cookie. Now, the medium, which to be clear was actually done on a large cookie scoop, the 3 tablespoon size. This [music] is the best of both worlds. You get from this size, more surface area, so there's lots of chewiness in the center and only a little bit of crisp on the exterior. That's my preferred cookie. You get a cookie like this, it's still going to feel somewhat big. One cookie is enough for one person. So, let's taste. The chocolate is still molten even though they're fully cooled. And then splitting [music] this bad boy. I mean, it's still gooey. Cheers. Listen, everybody has an opinion, but it is my opinion that these are the best cookies of all time because this is how [music] I want every single cookie I ever eat to be. It's perfectly balanced. The chew, the fudgess of the chocolate, but also the dough is fudgy, too. Lightly crisp on the bottom, but then the rest of it [music] so perfectly chewy and gooey and like sticks to your teeth almost like a nice like caramel. And then you hit the molten chocolate and you have sweet milk chocolate, but then you have [music] rich dark chocolate. The chips disappear in this. They just become a background crunch every once in a while. A little salty kick every once in a while. You can omit them. The cookies still good. But I like the little pops of savoriness [music] in this cookie. Cool. You don't need any more cookie recipes. You can stop here. Thank you so much. Subscribe. Love you. Bye. Don't forget the recipe is in the description. Go get it. Print it out. Put it on your fridge. Make it for the holidays. Make it year round. I don't care. Just make it."}
{"ThrMvNpQBM8": "today we are going to make a classic chicken sauté with peanut sauce I grew up in the kitchens of my family's Thai restaurants and this is one of the very first dishes I made when I was old enough to cook sat is a great party appetizer or a simple starter it's easy and fun to make hey team I'm jet Tila and welcome to ready jet cook where I teach you how to make my favorite Asian dishes from Pantry to plate but before we get into it take a second to subscribe to the Food Network YouTube channel so you can see all of my favorite recipes let's get started we have to start by soaking skewers we're using bamboo skewers these are probably like 6 to 8 in and you absolutely want to soak these so they don't burn on the grill so the bamboo skewers will hydrate within like 20 minutes but because they're bamboo and they're dense you can actually do this the day before it's not going to hurt the skewer at all so bamboo skewers are soaking it's time to make marinade and I'm going to need some coconut milk from the pantry so like a lot of my recipes although I'm teaching you chicken s I'm actually teaching you a dry rub a marinade the sauté and a peanut sauce so I want to break it down into a few different parts so this is my go-to chicken s marinade but before I add the coconut milk it's actually a dry rub so check it out I've got curry powder garlic powder sugar salt and pepper if you look at this spice blend by itself I've taught you a really great tide dry rub so that can get put together this is actually a go-to spice that just lives in my pantry when I need to make a grilled meat item one of the foundational items of Thai Cuisine is coconut milk I'm going to simplify it for you right coconuts are so many things in Thai cooking they are sugar in palm sugar they're coconut juice in young green coconuts but just remember coconut milk comes from mature coconuts when the Coconuts actually get brown on the outsides the coconut water in the the inside gets kind of tanic but the fats in the Coconut mature and that's how we extract this beautiful stuff this is really kind of liquid gold uh I grabbed two cans of coconut milk because I'm going to need the rest of it to make the peanut sauce so I'm going to leave this here but that's what I need to make the marinade so I'm stirring in the dry spices into that coconut cream and as you know fat is flavor and fat distributes flavor so when the chicken marries into this it's going to coat and it's going to get super delicious speak speaking of chicken uh I am using chicken breasts today there's no reason why you shouldn't be using chicken thighs in fact I encourage it I'm going to take the chicken breast and I'm going to cut it with the grain into those bite-sized pieces like 1 and 1/2 in wide and I've got my blocks and I'm cutting Against the Grain Into Thin tiles and those are going to be threaded really nicely onto the skewers they're going to absorb the marinade really really easily but remember be it stir fry or sauté I'm looking for nice thin tiles lots and lots of surface area and I'm going to marinade this for 4 hours to overnight you almost can't over marinade in restaurants to get ahead we actually will make the sautees we'll thread the chicken on raw and then we'll freeze the actual sautes before we cook them and we can sandbag them that way the chicken's going to marinade I'm going to clean up wash my hands and I'm going to show you how to make peanuts sauce all right so to get started I'm going to heat a saucepan to medium put a little bit of neutral oil in the saucepan because anytime you're using curry paste you have to fry that curry paste and sometimes it's in the Coconut fat this time we're starting with oil so curry paste what's in it a lot of things the very simple explanation is Thai curries are made with fresh herbs most other curries like Indian curry are made with spices so what's in here lemongrass garlic shallots Tha lime leaves basically very aromatic herbs to really expose the flavor of herbs you need to fry them up that's it it's caramelization now coconut milk I'm going to get a little technical here good coconut milk has about 13 to 19% coconut fat in it so two things one don't buy light two don't shake the can of C milk although this can is lying to you and says shake the can a pro does not shake the can because watch that top layer is coconut cream and I want that coconut cream to continue to caramelize that curry paste these are those little tips and tricks that really amount to huge flavor bombs now that I'm caramelizing in the coconut oil I can start smelling that all those amazing herbs are frying I can slow down that caramelization now by adding the rest of the coconut milk so you can actually see that the tail of the coconut milk is the water that it took to extract the coconut fat so next is peanut butter and I know you're wondering do you use the new V peanut butter with the oil separator do you use the old school peanut butter we ate as kids I like the old school stuff it's creamier it's got a little more sugar in it and I think it's just a flavor profile that we're we're all used to and between crunchy and smooth I'm going to leave that up to you I'm going to let you fight that out uh in your own house I don't care I like the crunchy personally cuz I want little bits of peanuts uh in my peanut sauce as you can see the peanut butter actually starts out pretty solid because when you grind a peanuts you get a lot of those oils there's going to be a point when this peanut butter warms up and melts right into the coconut milk and you start to see the transformation from kind of peanut butter and coconut milk into one kind of homogenized beautiful peanut sauce so that's all I'm waiting for here obviously my grandmother did not have the modern luxuries of prepared peanut butter the way she did it was to take a bunch of roasted peanuts in a mortar and she Stone mortared them until they became peanut butter and threw them in so I ain't got time for that I'm I'm just going to be real and I'm going to use prepared peanut butter there it is it's coming to a simmer the peanut butter is just about to melt into the coconut milk let's start to season now this is a dip for sauté so I want something that's sweet salty and a little bit sour and for the salty we're going to use that fish sauce and I know I've covered fish sauce in a lot of my other videos but it's basically just anchovy salt and water if think about it as soy sauce made for mancho me that's all fish sauce is so it has an incredible flavor when you're buying fish sauce make sure you're buying the fish sauce that matches the country that you're cooking number two really good fish sauce should be Amber and translucent right that bottle bottle of fish sauce that's been in your fridge for a year that's opaque and looks like soy sauce it's time to pitch it out and start over it's okay I'm I'm giving you permission to do that so there you go once it becomes a beautiful homogenized sauce once It Coats the back of a spoon that's delicious that means it will coat sauté perfectly peanut sauce is done it's time to start setting up for our sautees so the chicken has marinated it looks gorgeous here by the way so what I like to do is kind of visualize how much protein to actual skewer so I actually hold them where I want the protein to stop and I'm very just simply going to uh flatten them out find the surface area the thin flat piece and I'm just going to weave right into that point till I hit that point in my thumb where I want that skewer to stop another thing I like to do is I actually make lamb chops in this style of sauté so the marinade the peanut sauce so it's a really versatile recipe I'm really kind of teaching you three or four different recipes in one so yeah that's what I'm talking about right there I think that looks like a good size for an appetizer and of course I'm not mad at chicken thigh I think um uh the thigh is going to give you a lot more of a moist bite uh I I like a little bit of fat on the protein personally if you're using pork uh pork loin pork shoulder is the way to go if you're using beef I would probably go to the steak cuts and if you're plant-based uh very firm tofu and water would make phenomenal sautes and the only adjustment to the recipe for plant-based in the peanut sauce instead of using fish sauce just switch over to either a soy sauce or an amino acid sauce and you basically have a plant-based sauté there you go so I am looking at both sides making sure I don't have any bamboo poking through that looks good to me all right it's time to cook sautees are skewered time for the don't burn the bamboo skewer hack you're going to need two things for clean cooking sauté number one is a piece of foil I am obviously using a grill pan but the same hack works for an outdoor charcoal grill you want to foil the width of your grill grate in this case I don't want it that wide and I need it the height of at least that bare part of the skewer and I'm just going to apply it down on the grill okay second part of this perfect sa on the grill is oiling the actual Grill and because again I have a grill pan I could use a little paper towel and some oil on a outdoor grill you could use a Tong and a little bit of a paper towel or what I call the sacrificial um grilling seasoned towel so either way works that also has told me that the grill is hot because I see the oil just smoking lightly and I'm just going to lay the sautes on there with that little bit of foil protection and that way I'm not picking up pieces of sauté that have burnt skewers and because these are so thin be it on a grill pan or a charcoal grill medium heat meaning if I put my hand at the height of the meat I should be able to hold it there for about 5 or 6 seconds before I go whoo that's a little hot so resist the urge to peek and flip this thing over 20,000 times all right you want to establish a really beautiful Grill Mark at least on one side and the way to know is I'm always looking up the side of the protein but until I start seeing at least 1 or 2 mm of char on the side I'm not going to touch the sauté sauté like so many Thai Dishes you think are Thai are kind of um Fusion dishes saes come with the spice routes and they actually originate from Middle Eastern kebabs I do see some cook above the sides here I know I can start messing with it and to get that beautiful Grill Mark don't just go and lift but give it a little wiggle and once you feel it give now it's time to turn it over look at that perfect so same thing I'm going to kind of push back and forth once it releases I'll turn it over perfect sauté so remember these chicken pieces are so thin they're going to cook up really quickly so about 2 minutes on each side is perfect any longer and it's going to to dry out there's only one presentation side a chef worries about so if I nailed the grill mark on the top side I'm more worried about the cook through when it's on the other side I'm very happy with the sauté I know they are cooked through but still moist I have a beautiful Grill mark on them I'm going to go ahead and plate these and allow them to rest for a few minutes before I serve them all right so peanut sauce peanut sauce down let's pretty up this plate a little bit very simple garnish I'm just going to use a little bit of scallion and just a little bit in the sauce as well typically in Thailand it's served with a little bit of a vinegar cucumber salad and that's it I mean what a beautiful set I need to celebrate by checking my work here there's only one way to know if I've done my job correctly cheers that savoriness of the chicken kind of enrobed in all the spices and then you have that sweet and creamy peanut sauce that really comes over the top there it is chicken sauté and peanut sauce you've learned the marinade you've learned how to make this delicious sauce it's peanut sauce today and it could be peanut dressing tomorrow it could be peanut noodles the day after such a simple and delicious dish thanks so much for hanging out make sure to subscribe to Food Network's YouTube channel and we'll see you next time on ready jet cook"}
{"3AAdKl1UYZs": "I am Antonio Curluccio, welcome to my kitchen.\nI show you how to make the real Carbonara. Most of the people they get it wrong and let\nme show you why. Now this is boiling water to which we add in the ration of ten grams\nper litre of water, salt - has to be like this. And immediately then we put in, has\nto be boiling, pasta. In this case it's sort of spaghettini; the biggest size of spaghetti.\nWhile this is cooking, it takes a good ten minutes, and no oil please, no oil. You don't\nneed it, you just need to stir a little bit while it's in it and that's it. Now for the\noriginal carbonara you need the guanciale which is the cheek, the pork cheek and the\nRomans they are very special in that because they do it, they cure it like ham or like\npancetta and it's very tender, very tasty and tender. Now you have to cut it in chunks,\nyou can use, naturally, also pancetta; the normal pancetta which is this one here but\nI like the guanciale when I have it obviously. And this is a recipe for two people. Big chunks.\nThe Romans, they are mad for this pasta. If there is a Roman pasta it's this one here.\nThis quite a lot for two people, let's see. And the only thing we are to do now to make\nthe sauce is to take good olive oil, put it in the pan. There you are. Put the guanciale\ninto that and this is the beginning of the sauce and mostly also the end of it because\nthe rest is coming here into the bowl. And now you take some good eggs and for two people\nyou take two eggs. Oh lovely colour, look at this. To be a little bit naughty I take\njust the yolk and we beat it and to this you don't add any, any, any cream. Absolutely\nforbidden. So this is the beginning of the sauce. So we put a bit of parmesan, in Rome\nthey use also pecorino cheese which is a cheese to be grated. There are fresh pecorino and\naged pecorino but it's lovely to have a little bit of this. Abundant pepper. And another\nstir and this is the sauce. I wouldn't put any salt with it because the bacon here is\nquite salty, it's preserved. You reduce it a little bit because I'm going to see what\nthe pasta does. I can see it is still stiff so I put it back again, another three or four\nminutes. Now here's the bacon that has produced also quite a lot of fat. Should you be not\nwanting the fat, I show you a little trick. Here we are, and do this. You absorb a little\nbit of the fat and you take it off like this, very simple. So the pasta seems to be doing\nwell here. Let's taste, now should be enough. I switched off the gunaciale because it's\ntoo hot and it's exactly what I don't want, to be too hot. So now I take the pasta and\nI put it into the, yes, there. And you flavour it like this. You let it cool down in doing\nthis. It shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature\nenough to coat the egg around the pasta. And now it comes the pièce de résistance, the\nactual sauce. There you are. And now we stir it like this. You see usually by this stage\nthe heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become scrambled eggs. Not too scrambled\nand this is the Carbonara. And now the last touch which is the embellishment; parmesan\nor pecorino, depending what you like, and in my opinion, also a nice touch of pepper.\nThis is decoration for me. And this is the real Carbonara, the only one. And it's exactly\nhow should it be, creamy without adding cream because this is the usual thing. Like this\nis just fantastic. Mmmmm, come on everybody you should taste this, it's just wonderful."}
{"VvJm4pQZ04s": "- [Claire] We always say this, I know, but these are actually the best brownies you're ever going to have. They're gooey, they're\nchocolatey, they're fudgy. Oh, they live up to every expectation you think a brownie should be. (lively music) We took all the tips and the\ntricks from the internet, from our old gramma's recipes, from places we'd worked, to find the best recipe that we could. Throw out every other recipe\nthat you have for brownies. This is the one you will use going forward for the rest of your life. (lively music) I'm not trying to toot our own horn, but beep beep, you know. (lively music) All right, guys, as always, prep your tin. You know what to do, butter and parchment. So the first cooking job\nthat I ever had was working for a pastry chef and he made\nthese incredible brownies. When you start working in kitchens, they always say write down the recipes 'cause you're gonna forget them later. And of course, I did not do that, but there are a few things that I remember from his recipe that I really wanted to incorporate into our brownie recipe. Obviously, good brownies\nneed good chocolate, and the chocolate bar you\nwanna use is dealer's choice. You can go for something really mellow like a milk chocolate bar\nor go into something really, really dark, like an 80% dark chocolate would work really well in here. We're gonna double up on\nthe chocolate so we're gonna use cocoa powder as well. Because we wanted a really\nrich, dark flavor and color, we went with the dutch processed. You can use regular cocoa powder here, but we're always looking\nfor that intense flavor, that intense color. The one on the left used\nregular cocoa powder. It's kind of drier on\ntop and almost too dense and fudgy on the bottom. We're adding a little\nbit of cocoa powder here. We're gonna add even more later. Espresso powder just\ndoes a really great job of enhancing any chocolate\nflavor in a recipe. If you're worried about the caffeine, you can get a decaf powder as well. It's not gonna taste\nlike coffee or espresso, it's really just another flavor enhancer. When we add the hot, melted\nbutter to the chocolate, cocoa powder and espresso powder, it's gonna help melt\neverything down and dissolve, which is gonna help keep our brownies really fudgy later on. (lively music) Sugars, we have granulated\nsugar, and then when deciding between light brown and dark brown, the real difference\nhere is that dark brown has more molasses, ergo more flavor. I don't even know what ergo means. Again, just wanted to knock your socks off with the flavor here and dark brown was the right one for the job. And we're also gonna add a bit of salt as it brings out the\nflavor in any baked good. (lively music) So we're gonna have six eggs. Always crack your eggs\ninto a separate bowl in case you get any shell. Best way to remedy that\nis to use the egg shell. It breaks the surface tension\nand is the easiest way to get eggshell out of your eggs. You can start by adding\none egg to the sugar just so you don't make a huge mess. Once you get it going though,\nyou can add the rest of 'em, no big deal. You don't have to be super\ncareful like you would for a cake for instance. So working for that pastry chef, one thing that he did with\nhis brownies is he would beat the living crap out of the\neggs and sugar and really, really incorporate tons of air, so much so that it would look like a super thick pancake batter almost. This is what happens when you\ndon't beat the sugar and eggs, kind of just falls really flat, right. The great thing about beating\nthe eggs and the sugar is you create a really solid foundation and you don't have to\nuse a chemical leavener. Then you're gonna pour\nin that beautiful ganache that we made. Oh my God. Actually, when we were shooting this, there is a crowd of\npeople around us 'cause we couldn't get over how\ninsanely delicious this looked. Oh God, I just, I can't\nbelieved we baked these. Honestly, I could've just\neaten the batter myself. (lively music) I'm really upset that America can't get on the metric system, but like fine. If we're gonna use cups,\nalways scoop and level, to make sure we have the\nright amount of flour. If you just take the cup\nstraight into the flour, it's gonna be denser\nthan you need it to be. And you're going to sift the\nflour and the cocoa powder into the mixture to make\nsure we have no lumps and just make sure that we're really quickly incorporating it\ninto the rest of the batter. (lively music) And fold. Because we beat all that\nair in with the eggs, we don't wanna totally deflate that, so just get the dry\ningredients incorporated as quickly as you can. (lively music) Pour the completed batter\ninto your prepped tin, smooth it out to make sure\neverything's pretty level. (lively music) And into the oven it goes. So these are gonna rise quite a bit. After about 20 minutes,\nwe're gonna take them out. This is my favorite tip\nof the whole recipe. Take the brownies out and slam\nthem on your kitchen counter. It's gonna crack the top as\nwell as evens out everything and you get a much more\nconsistent texture. These are the same recipe. The one on the left is not\nwhacked, right whacked. At this point, we're also\ngoing to add a bit of sea salt, optional but highly recommended. Adds a little salty bite,\nsweet and salty, always good. With a lot of baked goods,\nyou'll stick a toothpick in and no batter remains, then you're good. It's kind of not the\ncase with these brownies. You will have a good amount\nof fudginess that comes out on the toothpick. Trust us, they've been in\nthere for like 45 minutes. They're definitely cooked through. They're just fudgy. When they do cool down, they\nalso will deflate quite a bit. It results in a really even\ntexture all throughout. Again, I can't say fudgy enough. I don't even like fudge,\nlittle known thing about me, but these brownies are insane. I need to cut these nice. They need to be a good, perfect square. It's so satisfying to see a perfectly cut batch of brownies, obviously. (lively music) Oh my gosh, a little tip too, is to clean your knife after each cut. You'll see a little bit of\nthat fudginess comes off. They're fudgy but they're not dense. (lively music) And that is it. I mean, look at that texture. Look at it! This is like your go to brownie batter. It's amazing as is, but you can also mix in\nanything that you want, more chocolate chunks,\npotato chips, pretzels. This is like a phenomenal\nstandard brownie recipe but feel free to go crazy\nand mix in whatever you want. Making brownies from scratch, you know, there's other options out\nthere that are easier, but it's one of those\nfundamental baked goods that doesn't take a ton of technique, but they also go with\neverything and every event. You know what I mean? Like you have a break up, brownies. Birthday, brownies. Like, they kind of work for anything. Just one of those feel good,\ncrowd pleasing deserts, that's just always a win. Okay, that's fine. I'm just gonna keep\ntalking and we're leave it and it's gonna be fine. - [Male] You're funny, Claire. - [Claire] (laughing) Stop. - [Male] You're so funny. - [Claire] You're so funny. - [Male] You're funny. - [Claire] Beep, beep. - [Male] You're slacking. - [Claire] I guess.

{"Cyskqnp1j64": "beef wellington has to be the ultimate indulgence one of my all-time favorite main courses and it would definitely be on my last supper menu my version is a lot lighter and sexier and for christmas i'm going to give it an added twist first off the fillet of beef now look at it it's beautiful first the most important part is to sear it salt pepper the fillet is the leanest and the most expensive cut of beef it comes from underneath the lower backbone a part of the animal which has very little muscle and this is what makes it such a tender cut very very hot pan olive oil and literally roll it around the pan we're not cooking the beef we're just searing it which will really help to give another layer of flavor and beef in lovely now use the side of the pan so the beef sears down the back when you tilt it it's a secret to get it done quickly it gives that really nice roasted flavor delicious once you've got the colour very carefully lift up the beef and see it on top and sear it on the bottom out and onto the plate english mustard what this does now it gives it a bit of sort of bit of heat just lightly brush the mustard over the beef so really important that you do this as the beef comes straight out of the pan as the beef starts to cool down it absorbs all that heat from the mustard horseradish is a really nice alternative as well just leave that to sit and relax as the fillet rests prepare the filling which is called a duck sale put 700 grams of chestnut mushrooms into a blender add a chopped clove of garlic season with salt and pepper and blitz [Music] christmas wouldn't be christmas without chestnuts and just crumble them in to the mushrooms the chestnut sweet nutty flavor works brilliantly with the earthy taste of the mushrooms and because they contain more starch and less oil than other nuts they have a much softer texture that is perfect for the filling that smells amazing smells like christmas once the mixture is finely chopped cook in a hot dry pan this removes the water from the mushrooms and intensifies the flavour [Music] you can see the water coming out instantly [Music] such an essential stage really critical to the success of the wellington that you dry those mushrooms out and get rid of all that water take the mushrooms up even further some fresh thyme in there which will make it really nice and light and fragrant when all the water's been fried off remove from the pan and leave to cool then start assembling the wellington stage one wrapping the beef fillet first of all these wonderful slices of parma ham and look beautiful overlap it and set it there so the secret of overlapping the palmer ham is to make sure it contains all those juices coming out of the beef in the traditional recipe for beef wellington a thick chive and spring onion pancake is used instead of ham but the parmesan makes the dish much lighter and its sweet salty flavor really complements the mushroom and chestnut filling a little touch of pepper no salt because the ham is naturally salty just a little twist of pepper and then from there your mushrooms and basically mushrooms go on use the back of the spoon to spread them nice and thinly half an inch from the ends rump holes no hop it every time there's meat now he comes next lay the beef on top and very carefully fold that over now we're going to lift that up and wrap the beef nice and carefully so all that mushroom and parmesan is encasing the beef all the way over push it nice and tight roll it nice and tight and go all the way over now the secret from here is to really let the clint film do the work just nip it at the ends and squeeze and what we're doing is just creating this wonderful sort of cylinder shape off and then just twist it nice and tightly and the tighter is the more perfect the shape then place in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up [Music] once it's set it's ready for the final wrap a little bit of tim film puff pastry beef now very carefully first roll the puff pastry over the beef until the two edges meet then trim off any excess pastry and twist the ends together to ensure the beef is completely sealed in its pastry case to set that perfectly and get it really nice and firm to make it really cylinder type clip them over [Music] and just pull that nice and tight but the big secret behind this is that it can be done the night before and the tighter the clint film the better the shape the more even the shape the more evil it cooks put it back in the fridge for five minutes to fill up again then take off the tim film always like the perfect christmas cracker to give the pastry a lovely rich golden brown color when it bakes brush it with egg yolk and then finally you don't have to do this but it's a chefy thing a little bit decoration back of the knife down and then just twist and mark the pastry when it comes out of the oven it's got that wow factor add a generous sprinkle of salt to ensure the pastry becomes lovely and crisp then bake in an oven at 200 degrees for around 35 minutes depending on how rare you like your beef once out of the oven it's crucial you let the wellington rest for at least 10 minutes this allows the meat to relax and reabsorb its delicious juices making sure it's tender and succulent nice and gently hear that pastry how crisp that is this is the bit we've been waiting for oh wow my god i'm in heaven and for me if you want a really nice change to roast turkey this has to be the ultimate for the table it smells christmassy the chestnuts the mushrooms and that nice crisp pastry on the outside look at it i'm ready to die and go to heaven [Applause] [Music] you"}
{"5Sa9nYKiYg0": "hi my name is jimmy wang i'm the director of culinary innovation for panda express here's how we're going to make the original orange chicken at home start with fried chicken we feel like when you cut the thigh me into about a one inch cube it kind of gives you the best texture out of every bite and also retains the best moisture so we wanted to use the dark meat to help to sort of keep that moisture in there while the outside is crispy the inside is nice and tender and juicy so using the wet batter to coat the chicken it gives a little bit of aeration to the crust and it also coats the chicken better so the batter itself has a lemon agent such as egg and we also use corn starch plus ap flour to help to have some sort of a crust with the wheat and then also a little bit of starch so that there's a crunch the panda express is the originator of orange chicken the story goes back to 87 chef andy cow was working with local chicken he was testing a couple different badges people smelled it so the customer was just automatically says i want that instead founder and chairman andrew saw the whole thing he was like this might be it we actually want to fry the chicken in badges at 350 degrees it's roughly about 25 pieces at a time so that way the pot doesn't get overcrowded we want to fry at least six minutes one of the things that we also need to remind people is that the shade of the color that you fry in here by the time you take it out and rest it's going to go one shade darker so we always want to go a little bit lighter when people think of fast food they think it's processed with chinese food there is no way to cheat it they always have to do it exactly the way it is or else it doesn't come up with the right result everything is very technical that's one thing that we're really proud of i think orange juice definitely gives the acidity that is needed the vinegar has to be the potency of it so you want it to the nose if you boil it earlier the vinegar comes off then you don't get it so that's why you can always smell the orange chicken when you go to the stores because that vinegar really hits at the end so we're looking for almost like maple syrup consistency when the chicken is nice and hot when you drop it into the sauce it's going to absorb right away so it could be a little bit wetter the sesame oil it gives a extra sheen and also a toasted nuttiness to the dish one of the reason why i think it becomes such an iconic dish there's a certain nostalgia about a taste of sweet and sour think about ketchup coleslaw barbecue sauce when you think about a sweet and sour flavor combined with sort of something very iconic as fried chicken that really really hits home it's really good you"}
{"kzBOTkQRp0A": "I've traveled the world and I finally figured out how to make the perfect hot chocolate. Hot chocolate isn't just a pastime, it's a religion. When the cool weather kicks in, you want hot chocolate. If there were any hot chocolate you're going to make, it's going to be one of these two. I'm providing two different variations for you just so you have flexibility. But I will say my preferred one is the second one, which you'll see in a second. So, let's make this, shall we? We're going to start by making our homemade toppings, which include whipped cream, marshmallows. Then we'll follow that with an easy instant hot chocolate. And then last but not least, my very best of all time hot chocolate recipe. You cannot have hot chocolate without whipped cream. You could skip this part. You could serve your guests or even yourself with just a plain old cup of hot chocolate. But I promise you, if you're serving other people, they're going to sit down and they're going to be drinking that. They're going to go, \"This is pretty good. I can't believe they didn't get me whipped cream.\" So make it two cups of cold, heavy whipping cream. You don't need any fancy gadgets. You don't need a hand blender, although it is very helpful to have a hand blender. You could just use a good oldfashioned whisk. So, you're going to start by beating this vigorously. Your arm starts to get tired. You can always switch to the other arm. This is a great time to practice ambidextrous qual. Is it ambidextrous? Ambidextrous qualities. Does this look natural? Cuz it feels like I'm fighting for my life. So, we're starting to thicken up a little bit. Now, we're going to add 3 tablespoons of sugar. Not all at once, just a little bit at a time. So, I'm going to start with about a tablespoon and we're going to keep beating. All right. It's thickening up a little bit more. Another tablespoon. Push that in there. We're going to add the remaining tablespoon. All right. So, we're pretty much there. You don't want to overbeat this cuz if you overbeat it, it'll get too stiff. And to me, a good whipped cream. It's going to be very soft peak. You can see that's like a Jimmy Neutron hairstyle right there. That's what you're going for. I'm adding two teaspoons of vanilla bean paste. And then you're just going to carefully whisk that in there. I don't want to introduce any more air to this. Just a gentle whisk to get it to know this beautiful whipped cream. We're going to actually pop this into a piping bag with a star tip attached to it. We have our whipped cream. We'll keep this cold while we make our hot chocolate. But before that, let's talk marshmallows. If you don't want to make it, that's fine. Go buy your own. Making your own though, you can control the flavor, you can control the texture, you can control the size of them, you can make them really mini, you can make them really big. It's also cool to be able to serve them to your guests and go, \"Hey, those marshmallows in there, I made those.\" And then they're going to fall in love with you. Half2 cup of water into the bowl of a stand mixer or a large bowl if you're using a hand blender. Then you're going to add three packets of unflavored powdered gelatin and you're just going to sprinkle that directly on top. You don't need to mix that. You don't need to stir it. It will hydrate on its own. Let that sit while we make our sugar syrup over here. 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar going into a small sauce pot. 1 and 1/4 cup or 385 gram of light corn syrup, not dark corn syrup. And finally, a/2 cup of water. So, we're going to stir all those ingredients together. And the goal here is just to get everything homogeneous. What I don't want is a giant layer of dried sugar sitting at the bottom. All right, we're going to set it to a medium heat, add a tiny little pinch of salt, and then we're going to bring that up to a boil. Once that comes to a boil, you're going to let it cook and reduce until it reaches 240° F. Cut the heat off and very carefully transfer this. You don't want to get this on your skin. It is unrelentlessly hot. You will regret it. Please be careful. We have our bloomed gelatin whisk attachment. Now, we're going to lift this bad boy up. We're going to start it on low speed. And this entire time, you're going to carefully slowly drip down your sugar syrup down the side of the bowl. Once it starts to melt the gelatin and everything is beginning to emulsify, you can increase the heat to medium, continuing to pour your sugar syrup, then increase to high while slowly adding the remainder of your syrup. Once everything's been added, you're just going to keep beating that for a few minutes until your mixture is thick, creamy, and white and holds a light soft peak. Now, at that stage, you can lower your speed to like medium and add in 2 tsp of vanilla extract. To make these mini, going to scoop this into a large piping bag, baking sheet. I like to add a touch of spray oil to the bottom so that the parchment that is then going to go on top sticks. You're going to lightly spray the parchment. Then, we have a mixture of one to one potato starch and powdered sugar. Give that a generous dusting. You honestly kind of can't have too much cuz most of it will shake off of the marshmallow. You just want enough so it doesn't stick. Piping time. So, we need to get an optimal size hole here. At this stage, you can pipe this on as thick or as thin as you want. If you go super thin, then you're going to end up with really mini marshmallows. Nice little line all the way across your baking sheet. You're going to rinse and repeat that until you've lined essentially your whole baking sheet. I fit about six on here. You might be able to squeeze seven, but I wouldn't push your luck. Take your starch mixture and then give them a light dusting over the top. This is going to help set that shape and again it's also going to help prevent them from sticking after they've cooled. Let these sit for at least 4 hours, ideally five, and even better overnight. Now they've been rested at room temperature. Now make sure to roll them back and forth to then get the edges coated as well. Just making sure there's no stickage. To cut these, you can do two at a time. I'm going to start with just one for visual sake. And you may need to dust your knife. This is like roughly a/2 inch thick. So, we're going to cut 1/2 in segments to keep these equal. Toss them together to get them coated in that starch. You have your own homemade mini marshmallows. Finally, hot chocolate. The first one we have is the easy cocoa powder version. This isn't the best one, it's the easiest. One cup of your finest cocoa powder, 1 cup of powdered sugar, 1/4 cup of light brown sugar, and a/2 teaspoon of fine sea salt. Carefully whisk that together. This will get into the air. You may cough on it. That's okay. That's it. That's your cocoa mix. You can add cinnamon, you can add cayenne, you can add whatever you want to this, but this is the base. The benefit of this recipe is you can store all of this in an airtight container like a mason jar, and you essentially have your own instant hot cocoa mix. Now, the ratio is important, though. So, here's how you make it. 1/4 cup of mix for every cup of hot milk. I'm just going to slowly gently mix that. And then you can just serve it. You can take your homemade marshmallows, pop those on top. Yeah, they float. All right, I'm going to go to the hospital now cuz that was so hot. It's really nice. It doesn't taste extravagant. It's just a solid hot chocolate that's easy. So, let's make the one that is the ultimate hot chocolate. How is this so good? Well, it starts with one lb of 60 to 70% dark chocolate. And you're just going to very thinly chop it. It doesn't need to be like paper thin, but you do want it thin enough so that it sort of starts to crumble a little bit. This is going to help a lot in the melting process. Once you have that all chopped, I'd like to give it one more once over the other direction. Again, just to help it get as fine as I can get it. We have 3 and 1/2 cups of whole milk going into a sauce pot. Followed by a/4 cup of heavy whipping cream, 1/4, 1/4 cup of sugar, half teaspoon of salt, and then 1 teaspoon of vanilla paste. You can use vanilla extract. That's fine. I'm using vanilla paste just cuz it adds a little more fragrance. Heat that over medium heat. Give it a little whisk just to dissolve that sugar. You're going to heat that just until steamy and hot, but not boiling. Cut off the heat. Now, we're going to add all of our chopped chocolate. Give it a little shake to distribute evenly. And then you're just going to let this sit for about 2 minutes. And then we'll continue whisking. And at first, it's going to feel like it's not coming together, but just keep mixing. Just keep waiting. And if it's not fully melted, you just pop it on low heat, stirring frequently until everything's melted and it's hot throughout. Be careful not to boil it. You will break the emulsion. Now, every chocolate is going to be a little bit different in how gritty it is. So, if you want it extra smooth, you can take an immersion blender and just give it a light immersion blendering. And that'll get it even more glossy. To make it even more perfectly non-gritty and smooth, you can pass it through a very, very fine mesh strainer. Now we serve. This is obviously inspired by our visit to Caret. I love the way they served it. I think it made hot chocolate feel like a special treat. Give it a nice pour. You have your whipped cream, which you just take your spoon and give yourself a nice generous dollop right in the center. Look at that. There's only one thing left to do. Out of all the hot chocolates I've ever made, it is the best hot chocolate I have ever made, and it will be the best hot chocolate you've ever made in your life. It's beauty in simplicity. I know I say it a lot, but this really is. There's not a bunch of ingredients in this. This is all about the chocolate. It exudes the flavor in a way that is beyond your wildest imagination. You have to try it. Whether you do the more ridiculous one that's all chocolate or just the powdered mix, you'll be happy either way. You've got your homemade marshmallows, you've got your beautiful whipped cream, and more importantly, you have a top tier hot chocolate. Love you so much. Subscribe. See you later. [Music] [Music]"}
{"Apv9PVWZ390": "Alright, grab a glass of water, pour it into your favorite pot. Go ahead and toss the sugar in. The ingredients for making churros are super simple. Stuff you probably already have in your kitchen. Take another half teaspoon of salt, add it to the pot. Stir everything well to make sure the sugar and salt dissolve completely in the water. Now just add some butter. Chop it into small cubes if you want, but no big deal if you don't. Fire up the pan on medium heat. Hang tight for the butter to melt. It’s speedy, takes about a minute. Then give it a good stir to mix things up. When the butter and water are on the verge of boiling. It's time to add the flour. Grab a cup of flour and dump it straight into the pan. Then toss in two extra tablespoons for good measure. Take your wooden spoon and get stirring. Whip that mixture like you mean it, fast and furious, to avoid any lumpy surprises. At first, the dough is gonna be sticky like a reality TV drama, but keep at it. Mix until it magically pulls away from the pan and forms a smooth ball. That's your 3 to 5 minute arm workout. It'll feel a lot like play dough, just less colorful. Transfer the dough to a clean bowl. Let it chill for 5 minutes. Spread the dough around to help it cool faster. Work smarter, not harder. Cooling the dough before adding eggs prevents them from curdling and ensures they incorporate smoothly. While the dough takes a little nap, let's crack on with the eggs. Break one egg into a bowl. Give it a good whisk like you're mad at it. Later we'll slowly introduce it to the dough bit by bit like a cautious first date, so things don't get all soggy and weird. For the second egg, there's no need to tiptoe around. Just crack it straight into the dough. And get mixing immediately. Honestly, I'm pretty lazy so I let the mixer do all the hard work with those fancy dough hooks. But if you're feeling heroic, grab a spatula or a wooden spoon and go old school. At first, your mix might look like it's having an identity crisis - part liquid, part solid. Just keep mixing and they'll eventually play nice and turn into a smooth, happy mixture. Give each egg its moment to shine. Blend it in fully before the next one joins the party. It's getting there, but the dough's still a bit too chunky. Time to call in the egg again. Only this time not a whole one. Just a bit of the beaten egg. I'll throw in about half for now. Then we can always add more if we need to. Oh, the dough's turning lumpy again, but no worries - we can handle this, just keep mixing. It's better, but still a bit too thick so I toss in the rest of that first egg and keep going. The final dough should be smooth, shiny, and thick enough to hold its shape. Ready to strut its stuff. Just a little more and we've got it. That's better. Honestly I could have added more egg for a smoother mix, but I'm feeling greedy today. All that's left is to slap some cling film on it. And toss it in the fridge for a little chill time. Meanwhile, let's whip up a yummy chocolate sauce for our churros. Mix a little less than a teaspoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water. Grab that chopstick or whatever and give it a whirl. Make sure it's all nice and blended. No lumps, just groove. Set it aside for now. Okay, let's get our chop on with the chocolate. No need to go overboard, just a smidge under 2 ounces or 50 grams will do the trick. I'm all about that 70% cacao dark chocolate life, but grab whatever chocolate you got lying around. Alright, take that chopped chocolate and pop it into a saucepan. Aim for one with a thick bottom if you can. Next up, sprinkle in some sugar. I know mixing sugar with chocolate might raise some eyebrows but trust me on this, it's gonna be scrumptious. We're almost at the finish line. Pour half a cup of milk into the mix. And we're ready to crank up the heat. Fire up that stove to low. And let's get that pot on there. Give the chocolate some time to melt down. Feel free to give it a gentle stir now and then. We're aiming for a smooth, thick chocolate mixture that's evenly blended and utterly tempting. Now's the perfect time to add that starch. But here's a little tip. Mix it well before you fold it into the chocolate. Go ahead and pour it in. And the starch will work its magic, thickening everything up and giving your mixture that extra creaminess and density we love. Let it cook for just a minute or two, until it thickens into a lovely, creamy texture. Alrighty, let's pour that yummy sauce onto a lovely plate. Truth be told, I could happily gobble up this sauce, even without the churros, but we can't forget about the main event. Now the only thing left is to fry our churros. Pour about half a litre of vegetable oil into a frying pan. Turn the heat to just below medium. And let the oil warm up for 3 to 4 minutes. Go ahead and pull that dough out of the fridge. Now it's not a must to chill the dough, but just between us letting it sit overnight really steps up the churro game. Transfer the dough into a piping bag. If you don't have a proper piping bag, no need to panic, just grab a regular plastic bag. Snip off one of the corners, and you've got yourself a makeshift pastry tool. It might not look professional, but it'll get the job done. Gently squeeze the dough out onto baking paper for perfect looking churros. But if you're in a hurry, press them straight into the pan. They might not be as pretty, but they'll be just as tasty. I highly recommend using a French star tip. It's a small touch that makes a big difference. Alright, dip a wooden stick in oil. Steady bubbles mean it's ready. Now here comes the best bit. Snag that paper holding the churros, and ease them into that sizzling oil. Watch your fingers though, trust me, getting burned is no joke. And yeah, I learned that the hard way. Press the paper into the oil and in a few seconds, the churros will float up like they're on vacation. Oops, I'm not very good with chopsticks and the tongs just can't grab the paper tightly enough to pull it out. Fry until golden and crispy. Usually takes about 2 minutes per side. But keep an eye on it, it's all about that perfect color, not the timer. After a couple of minutes, our churros are ready. Carefully remove them and let the oil drain. Now toss them into your favorite bowl, like you're serving royalty. And dig in right away, gotta eat them while they're hot. Hmm, the warm, crispy churros dipped in that rich, creamy chocolate sauce... absolutely irresistible. You gotta try it."}

you please let me know in the comments down below today we're going to make you dom giu means beef don means rice ball and mix together the beef ball have you ever heard yoshinoya or matsuya or sukiya many japanese loves judo but today we're going to make more rich luxury premium judong so let's get cooking so you can have a beef ball without rice right i know not everyone may have a rice cooker at home so let me show you how you can prepare rice without one i've got about three portions of rice here or roughly 480 grams and the first thing we need to do is wash it you will want to rinse the rice a few times until the water runs clear a good tip for this is to make a claw shape with your fist and gently knead the rice and then keep turning the ball around as you continue to wash it so just repeat that a few times until the water runs clear and then we're going to leave the rice to soak for at least 30 minutes before we cook it 130 minutes is up transfer your rice to a large saucepan and add your water for our three portions of rice we want about 650 milliliter of water so now we're going to put the lid on and turn that up to a high heat okay once it starts to boil turn down the heat and wait for another 10 minutes after about 10 minutes you will notice the liquid from the rice has started to disappear this is when we turn the heat off and let that steam for another 10 minutes next up i'm going to show you how to make a topping for arguedon onsen tamago it's a half boiled egg but we call it onsen or hot spring egg in japanese because these were traditionally cooked in hot springs which is not really hygienic when you think about it heat up some water in a saucepan but don't let it boil we want it at about 65 degrees celsius or 150 fahrenheit add your eggs and let them sit for 30 minutes next up we're going to make the sauce for our gudon i'm going to put this directly into a pan you will need 140 milliliter of water 100 milliliter of sweet cooking sake that's mirin 60 milliliter of soy sauce 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and this is optional but will give you a richie flavor a small amount of dashy fish stock get that all whisked together now we will add our vegetables i have half a washed burdock root and we're going to cut this up into small slices this burdock will make our gudong a little more aromatic and give it a little extra kick add this to the liquid straight away if you don't add this straight away the burdock will oxidize and go brown which we want to avoid if you can't find burdock in your country you can use ginger instead or even just skip this part next we'll take half an onion and add that in thinly sliced once our vegetable are in the pan turn to a high heat put on the lid and wait until it boils and now for the final ingredient our thin cut of beef spread the dial evenly in the pan and let cook for maybe a minute or two this will be cooked in no time make sure to give it a quick stir to make sure it gets cooked evenly once the beef is cooked through let it stew for about 5 minutes to absorb the flavor of our sauce and most important thing of all is to make sure it tastes good though okay and now we're ready [Music] so [Music] [Applause] okay the beef ball the goo dong is ready to eat mmm wonderful smell i can't wait to eat it let's eat it look at this [Music] this burlap smell it's so rich so good maybe this point is the most different compared to uh yoshinoya fast food goodness and also this onsen tamago it's very good very smiled and we all work together very well okay we didn't use a rice cooker today so it took a little bit longer but usually you don't is pretty easy to make and very fast to make so if you're busy or you don't have a lot of time the q dome is perfect i recommend you you guys send me a lot of comments and appreciate and today i want to reply to the some of the comments how does this man have such a western accent i love it thank you very much when i was a child uh about 11 to 15 years old for four years i was living in chicago in the united states so that's why i can speak english just a little bit in chicago i was going to japanese school so sometimes i forget how to speak english but right now i'm studying english so maybe someday i can speak more more smoothly and someday i want to visit united states again okay here is another comment what would be a good substitute for cooking sake okay if you can find a cookie sake in your country maybe white wine is very good or if you don't if you don't want to drink alcohol you can choose water but if you choose water maybe the flavor is less rich okay guys thanks for the comments if you have any other questions or any other dishes that you want me to make please leave the comment down below and remember

{"1J37-Me00dw": "[Music] Tomato egg soup is something many families make, but there are still many who can't make it quite right. Today, I'm going to share a new way of making it. Once you learn it, I promise you'll make it better than any restaurant. On cold days, having a bowl of this soup will warm your heart and your stomach. Let's take a look at how I make it. Start by preparing ripe tomatoes. These tomatoes should be fully ripened. Use a knife to make a cross on top of the tomatoes. This is a little trick to help peel the tomatoes more easily. Once done, place them in a bowl. Next, boil some water and pour it over the tomatoes. Make sure the water covers the tomatoes completely. After adding the hot water, stir the tomatoes around with a spoon. This way, they'll heat evenly and their skin will slowly peel off. After about 1 minute, you'll notice the tomato skins start to split open. Use a spoon to remove them from the water and place them on a cutting board. Now you can easily peel off the skin with your hands. Isn't that simple and quick? The peeled tomatoes are clean and ready to use. Once peeled, cut the tomatoes in half and remove the hard core. Be sure to remove the hard core as it's not edible. After removing the core, cut the tomatoes into thick slices. Then chop into small pieces. Once done, put the chopped tomatoes into a larger bowl. Now, prepare a small bowl and crack in three fresh eggs. Add a pinch of salt and whisk the eggs together. Whisk until smooth and even. Set the egg mixture aside for later. Next, take some white mushrooms by goo. Clean them and cut them into small pieces. Put the mushrooms in a bowl and set aside. Now, chop a bunch of green onions into small pieces and place them in a bowl. If you like cilantro, chop a bunch of cilantro and set it aside as well. Next, take a spoonful of corn starch, put it in a small bowl, add a little water, and stir it until it dissolves. Set this corn starch mixture aside for later. Now, heat some oil in a pot. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped tomatoes and stir fry on high heat. This will help the tomatoes release their juice. Stir the tomatoes quickly to cook them evenly. Once the tomatoes release their juice, add a large bowl of water and bring it to a boil. Once the water boils, stir it with a spoon to mix the tomatoes evenly. Now add a splash of light soy sauce. Stir well. Next, add the white mushrooms to the pot and cook them on high heat. You need to cook them for a while to let the flavors blend. Once the soup is boiling, we'll start to thicken it in three steps. Gradually pour the cornstarch mixture into the soup. Stir gently as you add it so the soup thickens slowly. This method helps the soup come together smoothly. After the first round of cornstarch, stir the soup. Then add a second round of cornstarch mixture. Stir again to let the soup thicken. If you add everything at once, the soup won't taste as good and the tomatoes will degrade. For the final round, add the rest of the cornstarch mixture. Once the soup starts to thicken, slowly pour in the egg mixture. This will create beautiful egg flowers that are soft and delicate. After adding all the egg mixture, stir gently to combine. You'll see the soup becomes smooth and velvety with beautiful egg flowers floating in the soup. Add the green onions and cilantro for garnish. Then stir to combine everything. This soup looks delicious and smells amazing. Now serve it in a larger bowl. And there you have it, a simple, tasty, and heartwarming bowl of tomato egg soup. As the weather gets colder, a bowl of this soup is perfect for warming both your heart and your stomach. That's all for today's video. If you like it, feel free to save it and try it yourself."}
{"R0Fxd13ogUg": "You don't need to go to Panda Express for\ngreat orange chicken. I'm going to show you how to make it at home in the easiest,\nmost delicious way possible. I'll want some rice with my orange chicken.\nSo as a first step, let's start some rice that'll just go in the\nbackground while we cook the orange chicken. I'll add my rice, then cover it up with\nwater. I'll use my finger to measure the amount of water I need,\nand then we'll start our rice maker while our rice cooks, let's work on our chicken. I\nalways cut raw meat on its own cutting board. That way you can throw it in the dishwasher\nafter and not ruin your bigger one. So for this, we're just going to want to cut our\nchicken into nice bite sized pieces. If you've ever had orange chicken,\nyou probably have a good sense of exactly what size those bites should be. Each chunk should look something like this.\nAs a note, I'm using chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts because it'll have more\nflavor and be more tender. In general, do your best to make sure that every chunk is\nabout the same size as. That'll be the best way to cook all that\nchicken evenly. If there's any extra large pieces of fat like this,\nI'll also sometimes trim that off. Nice thing now is I can just remove this\nwhole board and it's clean. To prepare our chicken for cooking into this\nbowl, I'll add some flour, then some cornstarch and\na nice big pinch of salt. This is our dry dredge,\nwhich I'll keep super simple and give it a quick whisk into our wet dredge. I'll add one egg, a splash of vegetable oil,\nan optional tiny pinch of MSG just to give an extra bit of umami, a pinch of salt,\nand I'll whisk this up until evenly combined. Add in my diced chicken and give it a nice\nmassage to fully coat it. Now, while we let this sit for just a moment, I will fill up my fry pan with some oil. We're going to want to heat this to about\n350°F. So while that heats up,\nI will move back over here and then we can start dredging. I like to use one hand for my\nwet dredge and one hand for my dry dredge. So I'll take each piece out,\nmove it over and with my other hand I'll really get in there fully coat that chicken\nand even squeeze. What that does is really make sure every bit\nof the chicken is coated, but it also helps to get some of those extra\ncraggily crispy bits when you go to fry it. And once each piece is done,\nI'll move it on to a sheet tray fitted with a wire rack. The wire rack makes sure that\nnothing gets soggy. Don't put too many pieces in at a time,\nbecause things can start to get really messy that way. And then with every piece of\nchicken, make sure to also shake off all that excess flour. You don't want too much hanging\non there. Believe it or not, in all the different recipes I've made in my life,\norange chicken has always been one of the most difficult ones to get right,\nbecause we all have this idea in our minds of what it should taste like. So when you try to\nmake it at home and it doesn't have that same super sweet honey like taste and glaze,\nsomething about it just tastes so wrong. So what's really nice about this recipe is\nthat it gives you that best of both worlds where it tastes homemade,\nbut it's not overly sweet like you're eating some kind of dessert chicken. By the time we finished dredging,\nour oil should be close to that 350 Fahrenheit mark. If it's somewhere around\nthere, you should be good to fry. It's always a good move to test one out. First, make sure everything's looking good,\nand depending on how much oil you're frying with, fry your chicken in batches. Don't do it all at once. While it's frying, monitor the temperature.\nYou may need to crank up the heat a little bit once the temperature drops. After you add\nin your chicken, soon after you add it. Also, make sure to move it around. Make sure\nnothing stuck together. You'll want to fry your chicken until it's light golden brown,\nprobably about 4 to 5 minutes. Once they're beautiful golden brown,\nshake off that excess oil and place them on another sheet tray lined with a wire rack. I always like to make sure that every bite of\nchicken is crispy, so I space them out to make sure nothing is\ntouching. That way we get no soggy bites at all. When I fry, I like to slowly drop each piece\nof chicken in like this. It'll help ease your chicken into that frying\noil instead of plunging it straight in from cold to very hot. If you're cooking at home,\nyou also don't need this much oil. I'm putting extra oil so you can see it\nreally easily. And because I fry things a lot so I can use\nthis oil again while we wait for our other chicken to finish, I'll just show you how\ncrispy this is. Our chicken's done, so I'll place it all on\nmy sheet tray and hit it right away with a pinch of salt. That way it sticks to the oil\nthat's still remaining on the chicken. Best song ever. Our rice is done. Perfect timing, because all we have left to\ndo is our sauce. The sauce is easy. We need one clove of\ngarlic, then a peeled chunk of ginger. Some people say ginger is easier to peel with\na spoon. I like to use a peeler and we'll mince up the ginger and garlic together. These are two of the classic ingredients in\nan orange chicken, but I feel like you sort of lose their flavor in a fast food orange\nchicken, which is part of the reason I love this\nrecipe so much. Into a pan, I'll add a splash of oil, then our garlic and ginger,\nas well as a few red pepper flakes. Stir this over medium heat for a few minutes\nuntil it's nice and fragrant. And once everything's smelling good and delicious,\ngo ahead and pour in some orange or tangerine juice. Tangerine. If you want to be fancy,\nuse a wooden spoon to scrape all those nice crispy bits off the bottom of your pan. Then add in some light brown sugar,\na touch of white pepper, rice vinegar, and then the zest of a whole\norange. That's where you get the real orange flavor.\nA pinch of salt. One more optional sprinkle of MSG, and then with some cornstarch and hot\nwater, I'll make a little cornstarch slurry and add\nthat to my sauce. This will thicken everything up. Once you add\nthat cornstarch, be ready for it to thicken fast right in front of your eyes. All you have to do to activate that thickener\nis add a little bit of heat and it should get a sticky, almost syrup like consistency. Turn down your heat, add in your chicken,\nwork quickly now and toss. For plating, I like to keep it simple. Drop down some white rice. You can season it however you want and add\nyour crispy, silky orange chicken. With most recipes,\nthe orange chicken stops being crispy after you put the sauce on,\nbut with this one, you're still going to get that crunch in every bite. Finish it off with some extra orange zest a\nsprinkle of green onions. Listen to this crunch. Take that Panda\nexpress."}

the question in this video you'll Master roasting The Humble chicken and getting the juiciest results every time yeah even if you've never done it before when you buy a chicken it had so much water in it that it's impossible to get a crispy skin that's why you're going to take the water out by draining it for 10 minutes a colander works wond so don't spread salt Manila all over your sink that would really suck now with a paper top remove any excess water because no water means crispy skin and crispy skin means happy belly am I right and don't worry about the inside that part uh can't get crispy anyways let me tell you a little secret come here your wet chicken will never be crispy so at this point we're going to add a little bit of oil to our chicken this not only gets our chicken super crispy when we bake it in the oven but it's a way for our spices to stick to it and uh coat it all the way around nice and evenly get every part of the bird from the wing from the back from the breast I could have been a masseuse in my other life she's all oiled up nice and coated now let's go on to our spices now when it comes to seasoning this bird I like to make a blend that's not only good for chicken but it's going to be good for everything poultry first ingredient we're going to put in is 1 to 2 tbsps of ocean I like to do two because I like to use this in the future 1 tbsp of sweet or smoked paprika I like the smoked version a little bit better 1 tbsp of that garlic powder 1 tbsp of onion powder and it ain't much for just for a little bit of a cake we're going to add in half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper we're going to get some herbage in there so we're going to add in 1 teaspoon of dried oregano and then for the last thing we're going to crack in some fresh black pepper and once that's all combined together you just made a perfect seasoning for not just chicken but like I said for anything Birds poultry you could even use this for steak or fajitas and Seafood we are ready you know it's one thing I wish people taught me sooner I learned that if you season from a Hy distributes the spices and the salt a whole lot better than if you were to go close like this it's because there's a lot more surface area see how I'm getting way more of the chicken as I go in height that is a seasoned breast right there we're going to do the same thing to the back side give it a little generous amount of spice cuz we don't want no part of this bird to be Bland I ain't with that bland stuff y'all know me in the crevices too yeah I think so and even inside of that cavity we're going to put in a little bit of that spice believe it or not this does drip into the inside parts of the chicken and you want flavor all over this D burd little bit more just for my own sanity I'm going to get the back one last time just to ensure that there's seasoning on every single part I'm not going to try to rub it too much into it cuz I like the seasoning to just kind of sit on top and do its sting undisturbed that looks ready to go into the refriger at for about 12 hours I know 12 hours might seem like a long time but you're not going to stare at the bird okay prep the night before so the next night y'all can have some dinner and it is optional too okay so don't think you have to do this but this just makes sure the flavor penetrates inside of everything you want a flavorful bird for your family you know here have a sample go ahead go ahead anyone can make a seasoned chicken and put it in the oven but let's take it one step further this crevice right here is not for show let's get creative with it you can add onions for a sweet flavor I'm using leak split down the middle and just putting it inside pair that with something like Dill ooh now we're talking and why not add a little bit of citrus to perfume this entire bird up now that is a chicken i' want to eat every day I'm going to be cooking this at 400° in the beginning for the first 10 minutes to get that skin started and then lower the heat down to 350 until the thickest part of the chicken which is usually the breast reads 165° fhe and yes I know you want to eat this bird right away in one bite but if you don't let it rest all the juices will come flooding out and we didn't wait 12 hours for a dry burd and as for them pan drippings you thought we was going to throw that away heck no that's flavor right there pour over your chicken when it's ready to serve it gives you that extra o you know what I'm an absolute sucker for it's this freaking skin I don't know if it's bad for you but all I know is good for me stop playing little bit of them pan drippings oh [Music] yeah m breast came out really tender and you know what that tells me the rest of the bird becomes tender one thing a lot of people don't talk enough about is how this lemon this onion Dill all the herbs that you put inside of the bird permeates inside of the chicken it almost gets it like a nice essence of all of these ingredients that's the wing right there I'm home alone so this is my comes right off the bone so next time you want to feed the family then not do a complicated meal or if you just want to try something new go ahead and roast yourself this chicken com out juicy every time and if you're a dummy I know you can do it and you ain't no dummy ohoh uhoh look at that made a mess wow"}
{"x6O9SwocyKQ": "mashed potatoes are a must especially when it comes to the holidays it's basically the side dish that keeps on giving am i right surprisingly there are quite a few mistakes when it comes to mastering the art of mashed potatoes we went through about 20 pounds of potatoes to bring you the ultimate creamy super smooth mashed potatoes they're seriously so good you're going to want to lick the plate there's two types of potatoes starchy and waxy for mashed potatoes you want a starchy potato a potato with higher starch and low moisture will yield a fluffier inside we're using yukon gold potatoes they're actually somewhere in between a starchy and a waxy potato they're harder to over mash and have a foolproof creamy texture we're going to peel the potatoes before boiling some people like to leave the skin on their mashed potatoes which creates a little bit more texture but for really creamy silky smooth mashed potatoes with a uniform texture it's going to work a lot better with the skin off quick tip to keep your potatoes from discoloring and oxidizing as they sit out place them in a bowl of cold water while you work after you've filled your potatoes cut them into one-inch cubes this way they're going to cook more quickly and evenly add your potatoes to a pot of cold water and add a very generous pinch of salt this is going to help build the layers of flavor as the potatoes cook which means you'll need less salt down the line now we're going to bring the potatoes to a soft boil over high heat once you've reached a soft boil reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 12 minutes you'll know your potatoes are ready for mashing when they're fork tender go ahead and remove the pot from the heat and drain the potatoes through a colander at this point you're actually going to place the potatoes back in the pot over medium-high heat and stir them around for two to three minutes that's just going to release any excess moisture at the end of this the potatoes should be super dry when it comes to mashed potatoes most people use a potato masher or even a fork some people use a potato ricer for a more uniform texture which we're also really big fans of if you don't have any of those tools and want to get a similar result you can use a fine mesh sieve place the boiled potatoes in the sieve and use a spatula to gently push them down i'm not gonna lie this definitely takes more muscle and is more time consuming but the potatoes are gonna be so silky smooth and beautiful it's really worth the effort whatever you do do not use a food processor or a hand mixer this is going to overwork the potatoes creating a gummy like paste and let's be real no one wants that now it wouldn't be mashed potatoes without adding some butter you want to use unsalted butter because it allows you to control the amount of salt in your mashed potatoes we made so many variations of mashed potatoes and taste tested all of them we tried cold butter milk melted butter sour cream cream cheese heavy cream and after all that we decided to stick with melted butter and heavy cream while some people do like sour cream and cream cheese we found that the flavor really stood out and took away from that uniform consistency and texture that we were looking for quick tip you always want to add your butter before adding any cream or milk this is going to ensure that the texture of the potato remains firm before being softened by all that cream if you add your butter and your cream all at once it's going to create this really soupy texture whereas if you go gradually it'll be nice and smooth and creamy so remember how we talked about building flavors this is another time where you're gonna season it with salt add your heavy cream to a small saucepan over medium-high heat this is also the moment when you can enhance the flavor of your mashed potatoes we're going to add some rosemary sprigs and garlic but you can get creative with other herbs and ingredients as well bring the heavy cream mixture to a simmer once it's simmering for a few minutes and that cream is getting really infused with flavor you're going to strain out the garlic and the rosemary through a sieve and then add just the cream to the potatoes little by little until they're fully incorporated remember if you add all the heavy cream at once it's just going to become a soupy mess as you fold the heavy cream into the mashed potatoes you're going to see this really smooth texture start to come together i mean it's so beautiful it's that easy your potatoes are finally ready to serve so because it's tasty we're going to top it with more butter we're also going to add some freshly ground black pepper some chives you can really experiment with your toppings but this is a pretty classic preparation or if it's that special time of year pass the gravy baby i mean come on what's not to love and there you have it the creamiest mashed potatoes you've ever laid eyes on or in our case are taste buds it's like luscious they're really they're luscious mashed potatoes they're luscious that's the only way to describe them kind of sexy like have we i mean we ate so many of them it's insane so many"}
{"L-KdsRzpyzU": "If you ever get that foggy and focused feeling where you're doing things but you're not fully in the day, this might be one of the reasons why. Long-term studies show that people with higher levels of low-grade inflammation tend to experience slower thinking and poorer focus as [music] they age. Now, you don't feel it all at once, but it's those moments when your brain just isn't as sharp as it should be. So, today we're making an anti-inflammatory soup that's always in [music] my rotation. It's warm, comforting, packed with flavor, and built around ingredients shown to help lower inflammation markers in the body. Also, there's one ingredient pairing here that does far more than you'd expect. I'll show you in a second. For those new here, I'm Dan Martin, chef and nutritionist, and I'll weave the science into the cooking so it actually sticks. [music] Let's get into it. Start by browning an onion in a little oil with a pinch of salt. The salt draws out moisture, which helps everything brown more evenly. This step is your foundation, the same way you'd build flavor in a curry. Now, when the onions turn golden, add minced garlic and ginger. [music] Keep the heat gentle here. You want them soft and fragrant, not brown. Both garlic and ginger bring natural compounds that help your body stay balanced under everyday stress. Next, I'm adding aromatics. Cardamon, bay leaf, coriander seeds, and cinnamon, but use whatever you like. This is the part of the soup where you can put your own twist on it. Now, for the turmeric. Turmeric's active compound, kurcamin, is widely studied for how it interacts with the body's protective pathways. And here's the trick I mentioned earlier. And a good [music] pinch of black pepper. Pipperin in pepper helps your body absorb kurkamin far more effectively, which is why traditional cooking almost never uses turmeric on its own. Add water or a light broth and stir. Then add diced [music] sweet potato. Sweet potato gives the soup body and keeps the energy release nice and steady, which helps avoid those little spikes and dips that can make your system feel under pressure. Now add your mushrooms. I'm using [music] shitake. They contain beta glucans and a rare antioxidant called ergoionine. Both of which support the gut immune connection. A huge part of how your body keeps things running smoothly. Now let everything come up to a gentle simmer. And once it's boiling, lid on for 5 minutes. [music] Next, add diced green cabbage. It softens quickly and like other brasacas brings natural compounds that support the body's own repair [music] systems, but with a gentler flavor that works beautifully in a broth. Lid back on for a few more minutes. And while that simmers, here's the short version of why inflammation matters for your brain. Low gradede inflammation is really common. Stress, [music] poor sleep, inactivity, and ultrarocessed foods can all nudge it up. Now, you don't feel inflammation directly, but your brain does. [music] When those inflammatory signals stay raised, your brain shifts into a slower, more protective [music] mode. Even the micro glear, your brain's immune cells become a little more reactive, which makes things feel [music] a touch less sharp. The easiest way to picture it is a city of traffic lights. Low inflammation is green light. Higher inflammation turns more of them yellow. Everything still works. It just runs a bit slower. And diets [music] rich in anti-inflammatory foods have been shown to lower inflammation markers in the body. That's why soups like these are really important to put into [music] your diet. Now, back to the soup. Turn the heat off and add tofu for some plant protein, but you can use whatever you like. Chicken, fish, eggs, all work beautifully, even [music] beans. Then whisk in your miso. Off heat keeps the flavor bright and preserves the beneficial compounds from fermentation. Now taste and adjust. [music] Mine needs a touch of vinegar. Add fresh herbs here if you like. I'm going with coriander and some fresh chili. Now time to serve. As you laded it up, remember this isn't a miracle cure, but including foods like this regularly. Colorful veg, mushrooms, fermented ingredients, and spices is one of the simplest ways to support your body over time. And soup is the easiest vessel to bring [music] all of that together. If you want to go one step further, your gut plays a huge role in this whole inflammation story. I've got a simple gut health bowl that explains things simply. You can watch it here. See you there."}
{"J7uUylxVktI": "Salut👋 Emojoie here. Today we will be making everyone’s favorite Tiramisu. One thing I've worked on for this recipe is to heat the egg yolk of the tiramisu cream. I will introduce the procedure from 4 minutes of the video. First, I start with the ladyfingers. Ladyfingers can be easily purchased to make the tiramisu. This time it is handmade, but it may be a little difficult for beginners. Whip the meringue to this level of hardness. Mix the egg yolk and meringue. Sift and add the flour to the bowl. Mix until the powder disappears, but do not mix too much. It is easier to pour it in the piping bag this way. Squeeze out to the same thickness at intervals. The length here is 7-8cm, but you can make it according to the container for the tiramisu. Apply powdered sugar. Let it cool after baking. Now we wil make the tiramisu cream. Many Tiramisu recipes add the egg yolk without heating. In that case, it is recommended to consume within 24 hours or to freeze immediately and thaw on the day you eat it. If the egg yolk is heated, it can be refrigerated for 2-3 days. This is Marsala,Italian fortified wine. Marsala is often used for tiramisu. This can be brandy or rum. You can even use either milk or water. Water is also used here, but milk works fine as well. Use a pan to cook Anglaise sauce (custard sauce). This method can raise the temperature more firmly than the sabayon which foams while boiled. Heat to 80-82 ° C with low heat and mix the bottom of the pan with a spatula. Be careful when the temperature exceeds 82 ° C, as the yolk will harden and become rough. Continue mixing for a while even after the fire is turned off. Transfer to the bowl. You can see that there is some thickness to it. You can use it as it is, but since tiramisu usually uses a foamy sabayon, foam it with a whipper. It looks delicious when whipped😋 Mix this with mascarpone. Mascarpone is expensive and it might be good to replace half of it with whipped cream. Please keep the mascarpone cold. If the temperature rises and continues to mix, it becomes dry and separates. Mix 2-3 times. I didn't use egg whites this time. For those who wish to use it, make meringue with 3 egg whites and 15g sugar. Unlike egg yolk, egg whites contain antibacterial enzymes that are safe without heating. If you add merenge, it will be a little thick, but I recommend it because it increases the amount😄 This is the espresso where we will soak the ladyfingers. Instant coffee is fine. Please make strong versions. Taste test and add the appropriate amount of sugar and marsala. Add ladyfingers to coffee. Handmade ladyfingers break easily, so soak them gently. Layer the cream and biscuits together. Cool in the refrigerator overnight to harden the cream. But of course you can eat right away. Sprinkle plenty of cocoa powder. You can also shave and sprinkle with chocolate. It's difficult to take out the first piece beautifully, so I'm serving the second slice instead. It is thick and creamy and the bitter taste and aroma of the espresso and cacao powder serve a great balance to the tiramisu. I wish I had made a stronger espresso like an Italian espresso. I don't feel any alcohol. Marsala is intended for fragrance, so you can just add vanilla instead. Thank you so much for watching today. Salut👋"}
{"RgmbV_2FmF8": "This much butter can only mean one thing. We're making croissants.

Once your 10 minutes has gone by, go ahead and remove the cover and we'll add in some cubed French butter. Reattach the dough hook. And again, we'll mix on medium low. This time, we'll mix for about 5 to 8 minutes. And we're going for a silky and elastic dough, not sticky. It may look a bit messy at first with all those butter chunks streaking through the dough, but if you give it a few minutes, it'll come together. Woo, my mixer's hot. That's another important note here. It's a lot of work for your mixer. At this stage, we'll take the bowl off the mixer and once again, pull the dough off the dough hook. And then we'll lift up our dough, form it gently to put it into somewhat of a ball shape, and then place it right back into the bowl, seamside down. And then we're going to cover this up and rest it for 4 to 12 hours in the fridge. But I've already made a swap so we don't have to wait. The [music] next step is to cut a cross into the top, which will help us shape the dough into a natural square shape later on once it's risen. [music] And now we'll cover and let it rise at room temperature for about an hour or until it's grown one and a half times its size. If you're brave enough to be making this and your dough looks like this right now, you're doing a great job. Next, we're going to punch right into the middle of that X we made earlier. Your dough should deflate like this, at which point you can shift it aside. Cover your work surface with plastic wrap, all running in the same direction. [music] And then we'll gently and carefully pull the dough away from its bowl from the sides. And once loose, lift it right to the center of that plastic wrap. I'm going to use a ruler for a guide during this part. I'm going to push away and pull back on these tabs to create [music] a nice even square. Maybe more like a rounded square. Once it looks nice and even, we'll fold in the plastic wrap from the bottom and the top. Then same thing on either side nice and tight. And then we flip and use our rolling pin to roll that dough into those corners. The goal here [music] is to create a perfect square with four sharp corners. Carefully pick this up and rest it on a flat surface in your freezer [music] for 25 minutes. While that's in the freezer, I'll draw an 8 in square in the center of a piece of parchment paper. Precision is very important here [music] because technically the better the square, the better your croissants. And then it's time to bring in the butter. We want a very precise amount of butter here. All the specific measurements are on my website, which is in the link in the description below, along with the whole recipe, of course. Once you've measured your butter, flip over your parchment. That's so we don't get any ink into our butter. And then cut your butter into nice even [music] rectangles so that you can arrange it all around that square and try to fill out the space. It can be a little bit tricky to spread this out evenly, but do your best. And remember that the better you do now, the easier your next step will be. We'll cover the top of this with some more parchment paper. And as a start, I'm going to get in there with the ruler and really push this up against the edges to make four nice corners. And now, most importantly, bring in your rolling pin and roll or push to try to get the butter as even as possible. Once it [music] all looks connected, you should also flip this over. And that way, you can see exactly where it's fitting in the [music] square. And if it ever pushes out of the sides like this, you can always push it back again. Although, try to do this in a somewhat timely manner cuz it is butter and butter melts. Once we get a nice square shape like this, go ahead and flip again, orient it like this in front of yourself. And we're going to wrap our butter as if it were a present. First, we'll fold over the top and give it a crease. Then, same thing on the bottom. Then, we'll fold in at the corners. And then, fold that whole part in like this. And then, we'll repeat on the other side. You can see now why I said this was a bit like wrapping a gift. And now, one more time, flip it back over. And while this goes into the fridge to harden, we'll grab our dough from the freezer. Unwrap your dough carefully and then give your work surface a light dusting of flour. And if you like, you could save this off to the side. I'll do the tiniest dusting of flour on the top as well as on my rolling pin. And now we [music] need to keep this 8 in wide just like the butter, but roll it out to 16 in long. My strategy here is to roll it forward with nice even pressure. Then push in the sides and repeat. The whole time we want to focus on keeping those sharp edges that we work so hard to make. Once you start to feel more comfortable, you can even pick the dough up like this and start stretching this way. as long as you're making sure to maintain that even thickness throughout. What we've made here is a very durable dough. Don't be afraid to really work it. The longer it gets, the more and more helpful the ruler is going to become to keep it nice [music] and straight. Eventually, when our dough looks like this, we are ready to add on our butter. Now that our butter is nice and firm, we can unwrap it. And as long as the butter feels like it's slightly [music] warmer than the dough, we can go ahead and place it right into the center. What we're doing now is making what's [music] called our butter packet. Fold over the top and bottom and pinch until fully sealed. And then do that exact same thing down both sides. Then without breaking the butter, lift it up, dust off any excess flour from the bottom, and then lay it down with the line in the center [music] facing you like this. And now this part here can be difficult. Our goal is to roll out the butter and the dough, two completely different textures at the exact same time. [music] And to do that, we're going to do a combination of tapping the dough like this and then rolling, but almost sort of massaging the dough [music] and butter like this. You also want to spin it quite often and make sure you have just enough flour under it that it doesn't stick. But don't put too much because it'll ruin the flakiness [music] of your croissant. I say this is more like massaging than rolling because if you've ever gotten a massage, you can think of the dough like your skin and the butter underneath like your muscles. They're a little bit tougher, but if you work them long enough, you'll soften [music] them out. This takes a little while, but be patient and repeat this process and slowly and eventually your dough will stretch. In the end, this whole process of rolling took me [music] about 15 or 20 minutes. Once it reaches our desired length of 24 in, the final step here is to trim off any wavy edges so it looks nice and sharp and square again. And now we're going to do what's called our first lamination, or as I like to say, we're going to fold it up like a book. When we do this, we leave a little space like this in the middle. And then here's where it really looks like a book. We fold the whole thing over itself. All those layers right there are the start of building those beautifully [music] flaky layers that we see in a croissant. The reason I said you could save this is because we're now going to lay our dough back in here and then fold it up getting it as tight [music] as possible like this. And then we take it to the freezer for 20 minutes and the fridge for an hour after. And after all that, you'll be left with this. It kind of looks exactly the same. Once again, lightly dust your work surface with flour. And now we're going to do that same process of tapping down the dough and butter, except this time there might be a few air bubbles that we need to pop. I find this second rolling process to be much easier than the first, especially because the time in the refrigerator made it easier to roll out. Here, our goal is to get a nice long rectangle that [music] measures 3/8 of an inch thick. This next fold we do is called the letter fold, and it's to add even more layers. If your plastic wrap has started looking a little tired like mine, grab some more. And once again, wrap it up nice and tight. Still keeping this in that nice rectangular shape with those sharp edges. And now, same thing [music] as last time. This goes in the freezer for 20 minutes and the fridge for an hour. And finally, it's time for the final roll. Same thing again. Little flour on the board, then open your dough and down it goes. The goal now is to roll [music] it to one big evenly thick rectangle that's 14 by 17 in long using the [music] very same tapping and rolling method as before. I find that at this stage, the rolling works better than the tapping, especially cuz we don't have to be so nervous [music] about our butter breaking. This entire process has been to create layers, and now we have 36 layers of butter and dough here. As I cover this in plastic wrap again, I'll tell you the good news and bad news. The good news is that we're finished folding. But the [music] bad news, this now has to go in the freezer for 20 minutes and then the fridge for at least 8 hours, [music] if not overnight. I'm so sorry. Once our dough is finished resting [music] overnight, we can move on to shape our croissants. And to do that, we need to prepare our oven for what's called proofing. This process will make sure that those 36 layers we just worked so hard making will puff [music] up instead of melt away when we bake. And all we do is bring some water to a simmer and then place it at the bottom of our oven with the oven turned off. What we're basically doing is creating a nice humid day inside our oven. 5 hours before we want to eat our croissants, we'll take our dough out, unwrap it. You can tell I'm starting to get hangry since I'm just ripping it now. And then we'll trim it down so it measures 14 by 16 in long. And once we've got a nice perfect rectangle, we're going to measure it and split this into four smaller rectangles, each measuring 4 in across. Then with each of those rectangles, we're going to cut them diagonally across from corner to corner. Still trying to keep things as perfect as we can. And we're done with the ruler. To roll our croissants, we'll pick the base of each triangle up and stretch it out a little bit like this. And then pull and stretch the whole piece of dough all the way to the tip. And now we roll. [music] I've been waiting to do this for a long, long time. Carefully pick this up now and lay it seamside down on a silicone mat or parchment paper lined baking sheet. I think rolling them up like this is my second favorite part of making croissants behind eating them because I'll be honest, there are a lot of other parts of making these that are not that fun. Because these will expand quite a bit, I'm only going to put four croissants per baking sheet. And now, after adding a light layer of plastic wrap, we're going to place them in our oven to proof for two to two and a half hours. And with the power of movie magic, we don't even have to wait. I'll carefully peel away my plastic wrap and shift this off to the side while I do the finishing step here, making an egg wash that consists of one egg yolk plus a little bit of heavy cream. Mix this together until uniform. And our final step before baking is to paint just the tops of the croissants, not those sides where we see all those layers. This is the moment where you channel your inner Picasso. And I'm even going to use a real tiny paintbrush. [music] Can we maybe play a little classical music for this part here? I feel like that would be nice. [music] These will now go into the oven at 350 Fahrenheit for 35 minutes or until golden brown. And while they bake, I'll keep my fingers crossed. My oven door is pretty dirty today, so I'm just going to show you a random video of another croissant baking instead. Pretty cool, isn't it? Homemade croissants. Look at these. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing, but the first thing that comes to mind after all the time we just spent baking these is I just want to squeeze one. Before doing anything with these, it's important to let them cool down for 20 minutes. And when you think about it, you always see bakeries selling them at room temperature. So, we're going to do the same. But after those 20 minutes and all the other time we spent making these, we are left with this. And check out that cross-section that we got here. That is how you make a croissant at home. I'm going to go to sleep now."}
{"7TSexgaX8SY": "well hello it's been a while since we've done a recipe hasn't it and what better way to start than with one of my most favorite bites of food of all time a luscious juicy perfectly cooked medium rare steak with a nice sauce is great but what about crispy hot salty french fries you know it's like the perfect combination and it is steed frats to begin we'll be prepping our fries for the first fry then we'll cook our steak all the way through while that rests I'll showcase two sauce options one that I think is better and one that is easier then we'll come back for our final fry and plate up there are two ways to make frats in today's modern society you make them yourself which obviously there's so much honor in that you could tell people you made them from scratch you have all the control on the final product so we're going to make them first and then I'll show you another version that's even easier but let's start with this because this is way cooler rusted potatoes you're going to take each of them and you're going to peel them completely so I'm peeling these over parchment paper also you don't have to do this but anything that requires peeling and a ton of peels instead of doing it all in your sink and throwing it down the garbage disposal you could very easily do it over parchment paper and you're clean instantly instant clean board and then you're going to cut your potato into fries simple as that if you don't have one of those I totally get it guess what you can just do it with a knife first I'm going to flatten this out right I'll move that guy over you're going to start with about a/4 of an inch cut into a/4 of an inch board or plank if you will you're going to take each of these planks and you're going to do the exact same length cut a/4 of an inch the long way and what you end up with is batons also called french fries that's it cut them as thick or as thin as you want I would recommend not going any thicker than about a/4 of an inch around we have 3 and 1/2 quarts of water in here boiling and to that I'm going to add 2 tpoon of baking soda and 1 tbsp of white distilled vinegar this is going to help form that skin around the french fries that you want and also going to speed up the myard reaction we want crispy crackly exterior fluffy interior that's going to help with that and then of course I season my water just a bit with salt because you want the fries to taste just as delicious on the outside as they do on the inside you ever eat a big french fry and it's salty on the outside but 90% of it is unsalted that's cuz they didn't salt the water fries are going to go into our boiling water and we're just going to barely barely barely cook them it's a par boil I don't want them cooked all the way through they should not fall apart after this so we're going to give these a little stir when you do stir they're probably going to notice oh the water Stop Boiling don't worry just let it go we don't need to be too worried cuz the water is still just hot enough to parcook them it may come up back to a boil it may not just monitor them closely do not cook until they're completely cooked through we want them like 50% of the way cook through 1 to 3 minutes roughly so how do you check if they're done you just take one out try to find one that's average size pop that guy out we're just going to check him how's he looking ow so the outside's starting to get cooked it's definitely flowery there's a little bit of the potato starts getting on my fingers if I bend it and crack it see how it didn't snap it's it's like kind of raw kind of cooked done it didn't go it just kind of gently broke if I squeeze it with my fingers it's not going to turn into mashed potatoes they're ready to remove drain them on a wire rack you're going to want to move quickly here so they don't overcook you're better off pulling these a little too early than pulling them too late so think about it like that if you're like ooh I don't know if they're quite there yet maybe I should let them go longer don't I'm going to shake these out just so that they're evenly dispersed you may even want to spread these between two sheets cuz these will continue to cook so I am going to get another sheet tray and just spread these out cuz this is going to cause them to cook way more than I want them to all this steam is going to keep cooking them okay let them cool completely you can even pop them in the fridge to cool them faster and then once they're cool we do need to dry them off we're just going to gently dab them dry you really want to get them as dry as you can this is a little trick you don't have to do this but it does help get them crispier so we're going to dump these inable we're just going to add a little bit of potato sarch to that and just give them a toss it's going to help crisp them up but it's also going to help keep them separated shake off that excess shake off that excess take your fries gently spread amongst a clean sheet tray repeat with the rest of your fries and you're going to take that bad boy and pop it into a freezer until Frozen when you're ready to fry your fries vegetable oil about roughly 34 in a 74 pot now the first fry is at 315 fah and we're just going to lower these bad boys in carefully Frozen in batches not all at once now right now we're just forming the exterior crust we want to dry them out but we're not going to get the full color we're not taking them all the way yet so so as soon as the bubbling starts to subside and your fries are starting to get dried out in the exterior they're going to remove them drain them now the fries are ready for their second fry but first steak there are many ways to cook a steak and many of them are good honestly I'm not going to sit here and Sh on the options but nine times out of 10 when I cook a steak I don't do Sid I don't do reverse sear I don't do some sort of fat bath I've done those before and they do work well but the tried andrue method that every Chef on Earth has always used and always delivers is is the classic pans Seer butter-based method you've seen it before but there are crucial few tips you need to know first of all steak choice we have a beautiful New York strip you can see the beautiful marbling in these staks theyve been temped to room temperature every restaurant I ever worked in every restaurant that I know that has Michelin stars they tempt their steak because the surface temperature being room temperature makes a big difference in the myard if it is colder and you go in with a colder steak it will take you longer to get a myard you want that myard as soon as possible so you can avoid overcooking the steak period end of story you can dispute me in the comments I don't give a start with a New York strip or a ribeye and make sure it is at least 1 and half to 2 in thick if it has a really thick fat cap one thing I will do is I will score the fat cap so carefully I'll get a sharp knife and you can do it once you go down One Direction don't cut through the meat just through the fat about a/4 inch apart each and then you can go again the other direction and kind of create a diamond shaped pattern and that's just going to help render that fat it's going to prevent the steak from curling this is this is especially important for something like a New York strip because the New York strips do love to curl now always Pat it dry I want no wet steaks going in here make it as dry as physically possible the beauty of of a 1 and 1/2 2in thick steak is it is almost impossible to over season this so we're going to season it very generously with kosher salt this is Diamond kosher the greatest salt on Earth and look I want Total coverage with the salt just like that give it a little rub and you'll notice a lot of that salt falls off that is why you maximally salt little bit of pepper thing rub it around flip repat it on the other side season high in the air for maximum coverage then you just drag that steak through all that seasoning and pick all that up we're ready to sear 12-in pan medium high heat high temperature oil vegetable oil canola oil avocado oil you're going to do just enough to Goat the Pan about two to 3 tablespoons I don't want it drowning in the oil but I also don't want it you know Barren little trick I like to do is take my remaining paper towels and I'll just let it sit on the paper towels because that salts is going to draw out moisture and you do not want any of that moisture is your enemy this oil is getting pretty hot you want it like just barely smoking ideally you don't want to take it to the smoke point but look it happens if you see a little bit of smoke you put the steak in stainless steel is optimal for this kind of a steak you can do cast iron people love cast iron but I actually prefer stainless steel pan hot we're going to take our nice dry steak we're going to gently lay that in away from us press it into the pan you want full contact full contact here it's okay to press it down for a little bit just try to avoid touching the actual pan because that's going to solidify that position so it's not curling in any part of that steak you'll let that sear for about 2 to 3 minutes then we'll check the underside little secret if you have a steak that's being finicky and you want to lay it down you could put like a tray on top but these are fire these are little Chef's press you just they're lightly weighted pretty sick so after like 2 three minutes has elaps just be sure to check the underside if it looks like it needs more time give it more time but mine does not so I'm going to give it a flip we have a beautiful crispy crust now we're going to let that sear for another minute or so on the other side and then after that one thing I like to do is bring the steak to the edge of the pan lower the heat to medium see that fat cap we're then going to turn the fat cap towards the edge of the pan tilt the pan and crisp that fat cap up we're also going to help render that back cap this would probably smarter to do with tongs I'm doing with a spoon at this stage we're then going to add some lightly crushed garlic to the pan a handful of fresh thyme and a few tablespoons of butter honestly a lot of butter probably closer to 1/4 cup the heat is medium medium highish get your butter to melt you can put your garlic and your thyme on your steak once that butter is mostly melted push the steak to the far end of the pan turn the pan towards you and repeatedly base your steak with your butter over and over and over and you're going to do this for about 1 to 2 minutes or just until the internal temperature registers to 135 fhe which is medium rare that is the only R temperature but if you'd like to cook more then just keep going until it's cooked to your liking now once your steak is beautifully seared you got Brown butter it's herbaceous it's garlicky and it's cooked to your liking you can carefully remove that place it to the side to rest a lot of the time I'll take that finished garlic onto the steak nicely just give it a few more once overs with your brown flavored butter let that rest for 5 minutes at this stage what would you do just sit around no sauces there are two sauces for you today I've got a favorite of mine and then a much easier one we're starting with the favorite lantro coot sauce inspired by relay uh which is a shop that's known for their staken freets in Paris I think mine's a little better parsley you're going to thinly slice that about 1/4 cup finally chopped I usually like rough shien not it and then I'll run my knife through again and that's how you get a real fine chop same exact amount finally chopped Teragon you know make it a little Flinch that's fresh Teragon not dried shallot and garlic both then Le sliced we have one cup of butter a quarter of that is going to go into a small pan medium Heat once that butter is melted and bubbling but not brown we're going to add our shallot garlic in you don't really want to hear Sizzle because we're sweating the veg I don't want any color on it it's okay if you do but ideally not tiny bit of salt to sweat the veg that's going to draw moisture out that's going to make it nice and sloppy wet get that mixed in with the butter the Heat's still around medium medium low if needed if it's getting cooked too fast you can always reduce that heat I'm going to let that sweat about 2 to 4 minutes until the vegetables are really nice and soft for the remaining amount of butter that remaining three 1 qu cup of butter while that's going just melt it you can melt it in a microwave you can melt it in a pot I don't care I'm going to melt in the microwave BRB all right that's done heat is off I've got a high power blender right here now depending on your blender you may need to let this cool down but I don't care God that smells delectable brother pop our blender on and we're going to add two teaspoons of Capers 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard a nice one grapy Pond works but I prefer a nicer one literally any other brand one tbsp of shirashi you get that at an Asian market you can also skip it it's not a necessity but it tastes real good 2 tasp of wor stre sauce 1 teaspoon white distilled vinegar pinch of salt 5 leaves of sage and seven leaves of Basil roughly right give or take it's not that big of a deal then we're going to add one fresh egg yolk you're going to add six enovy filets now remember those chopped herbs earlier you're going to add 2/3 of each of those just leave a third behind we're going to stir that into the sauce later got my melted butter here have it to the side going to blend this on high speed till as smooth as possible very simply as this is blending you're going to reduce to a medium speed and and then you're going to slowly stream in this butter you may not use all of it you may only use half use your eyes all right that's actually roughly where I want it so I I left about a quarter of the butter behind you could use all of it it won't hurt the sauce I'm looking for a specific color and I'm looking for more of like a medium light green it's nice and thick we're going to s in the remaining herbs and I also want to add about a tablespoon of very thinly sliced chives the thinner you can go the better this is like every Chef's favorite Flex it's a great way to tell how sharp your knife is but it also is a great way to see someone's technical skills and attention to detail so that's going to go in you see up chives On A Line Station dude you're I've been yelled at so many times it's crazy rightfully so just stir that in look at this dude now always taste it first make sure it's where you want it oh tastes great you can add a little extra salt or white distilled vinegar to taste if needed if you want a little brighter a little saltier I'm happy with this now let's move on to our easier sauce now for the aav sauce shallot one this is much simpler okay just take the shallot cut the top off cut the bottom off cut it in half little4 in batons and then once down the middle yeah look a little little dice I also like a little garlic in my up the garlic on the other hand I want more subtle and it COK more subtle flavors out instead of dicing it or finely chopping it you're just going to thinly slice it so pan medium Heat 2 and 1/2 tbsp of unsalted butter once that's melted and bubbling you're going to add rough cracked black pepper corns to toast in order to rough crack those you're going to take a pan or a mortar and pestle and just get them roughly cracked I don't want tiny little particles I want big chunks all right to that in a pan medium heat for about 25 seconds just until very very fragrant then you're going to add your shallot garlic just a touch of salt just get that sweating and sauté reduce the heat to medium low we're let that cook just until softened 2 minutes that smells so good what is that starter pack right here dude shallot garlic butter pepper corn once you get there you're going to crank that up to medium high be careful cuz this might flame up Brandy 1/4 cup that will ignite if I shake this pan should I ignite it all right F say that's what happens it'll stop now once that's pretty much 80 90% reduced also called o we're going to add a/2 cup of beef stock a nice one bring that to a boil reduce that by half about 1 to 2 minutes it'll happen quick especially if it's in a wide Pan the less surface area in your Pan the slower it will reduce the more surface area the faster it will reduce all right at that stage you're then going to add 1/2 cup of heavy cream W I'm I'm going to do another take that that was crazy stir that in and then we're going to let that reduce just until slightly thickened like 30 seconds to a minute oh yeah see that you might as well consider that pretty nap a dude now you could stop here and season it but I do like to add a couple of tablespoons of cold butter swirl that in until it's melted and emulsify that's just going to make it a little extra glossy a little extra Rich a little like cling to the steak you know now taste here's what I'm going to add little salt to taste always taste and season before you serve I'm also going to add about a teaspoon 2 teaspoons of wor Shure sauce optional we'll just add a little extra flavor and our aav is done now it's time to go back to our fries for their second and final fry this is the crisping moment now once you're at 350 you have to be very careful here this is an important moment they will get too dark we don't want them too dark this will probably happen faster depending on elevation blah blah blah blah blah so many things so dunk them in and go just until they're crispy and the bubbling is subsided and his little color has been added basically going to drain them slightly into a bowl Co your salt you always want to Salt these while they're still hot I salt them in a bowl while tossing constantly just so that they get even coverage and that is our first method of making delicious fruits a nice Golden Bronze crunchy and delightful now let's talk about method two uh-oh listen I've tested a ton of french fry methods and the method I just showed you is great it would be better if you froze the fries a second time before the final fry but that's just a whole another step I me it's like 2 days of waiting for French fries if you don't have time and you want really surprisingly good fries find any brand of Frozen fries in the frozen food section and instead of baking them just deep fry them that is it 325 350 F vegetable oil 3 quarts in a 7 qu pot and you literally just fry them directly from Frozen now once those are golden brown crispy and hop through which really only takes like maybe 2 minutes you're going to spider them out drain out the excess oil and then immediately drain them most of these fries are already seasoned you don't really need any extra salt so I would taste one first before seasoning them look at this dude this is crazy I mean like it works so well and they don't Brown too much much they got that nice snap they've got that fluffy interior listen that is so hot but it is delicious so to Plate this you're going to need a nice big plate going to load that plate up with fries be generous you know I want it like two times the amount of fries a normal person would eat because we're not normal people pile them up but leave a little slot maybe a third of that plate for your steak speaking of once your steak is rested you will take that beautiful luscious piece of meat and you're going to slice it thinly slightly less than 1/4 in fin it out beautifully so you can see that nice nice medium rare lay it onto your plate and then you're going to Sauce your steak down one side on the direction of the fries so it covers half your steak a little bit of your fries here I'm using lantro coat sauce but obviously you can use the aav if you wish both are absolutely delicious it's up to you hit that with a little bit of flaky salt on top thinly sliced chives and serve immediately this is a steak at FRS just a steak by itself would be lovely but this sauce takes it overboard first of all the beef is Juicy it's tender Ultra fatty and urious like entot sauce you would think would be too rich but it's just perfectly balanced it's a little acidic tiny bit of sweetness and so herbaceous and fragrant and refreshing and get creamy and get salty and it's everything you want and you

{"NWzW08XasxY": "If that doesn't impress your friends I don't \nthink anything is going to! Hi, my name's Joel, I'm a chef tutor from the Waitrose Cookery School \nand today I'm here cooking a lobster thermidor. This is the perfect dish for any special occasion \nwhere you really want to bring the wow factor and impress your friends. Lobster's always quite \nextravagant but that's what Christmas and New yYear's all about. If you want to try it yourself, \nthe link to the full recipe is in the description. We are going to start off today making the \nthermidor sauce. I've just turned my pan on, I've got it on to a nice medium heat, not too hot. \nSo I've got two shallots here, these are Echalion shallots, I want to finely dice this, that way \nI'm just gonna be able to extract more flavor. I'm gonna get a tablespoon of butter into my \npan now. It's foaming nicely, just sweep all those shallots in and just let that sweat down. \nI don't want to get any color on the shallots. I'm going to add a good bunch of tarragon, \nyou can pick the leaves off if you want but it's no problem to put them in whole. It has \nthat really beautiful kind of aniseed flavor, it boosts all the other flavors especially when \nit's in a creamy sauce. The next step is i need to add 300 mils of fish stock. I'm going to move this \nover here onto a really high heat and I'm just going to let that bubble away. You'll also notice \nwe didn't season anything at this stage, there's no salt going in. If we salted that now it's \ngoing to really intensify and then what I'm going to do is bring in a smaller pan to begin making my \nbechamel sauce. Bechamel is another classic French sauce it's really worth everyone learning this one \nokay because it's the it's the mother sauce which means you can make a lot of sauces from this. \nI've got this pan on a little bit warmer now, I want to be able to melt a tablespoon of \nbutter in there but get it foaming as well. I'm going to add a tablespoon of flour. \nWhat I'm going to do here is actually cook the flour out a little bit just like that \nwith the butter on its own. So at this point I'm going to start adding my milk. Now every time that \nmilk dissolves and it's absorbed by the flour, I'm adding a little drop more. It's really \nimportant that you don't add all your cold milk at once because the flour won't be able to absorb it, \nyou'll knock all the heat out and it'll just take a lot longer. If you have a look at that now it's \nreally nice and thick. I'm gonna pop the sieve over the top of my bechamel sauce and then just \nstrain in the fish stock directly from the pan, about two to three tablespoons worth. We've got \nsome really lovely shallot flavor, some really lovely tarragon flavour, that's all in there so \nI'm going to bring this together and it's going to thin it down a little bit. The trick is to \nreally stir that through and get it smooth again. So at this point, now that my fish \nstocks in and it's all nicely smooth, I'm going to add double cream. I'm going to go in \nwith three tablespoons so as double cream reduces that's going to thicken as well, we're losing \nwater and everything else is being left behind. So this is the kind of consistency I'm after now. \nI'm going to transfer this to a bowl to cool down. So next thing I'm going to add is English \nmustard. This is nice mustard because like it's got the heat and it's also got the color \nas well. Thermidor sauce as a real vibrant yellow looks awesome - two tablespoons, it's quite alot \nactually. And then I've also got a really lovely ingredient here, this is a whole nutmeg. I'm going \nto use about half of this and a microplane is the best thing to use and then I'm just going to \nstir those bits through. Now this has cooled down enough that it definitely won't scramble the \neggs at this stage, it needs to be quite hot to do that. Egg yolks can go in. To that I'm going \nto add some salt and pepper, everything's just going to get stirred through. Just look at the \ncolor of that, it's amazing. I'm just going to cover it with cling film and put it on to the side \nand we'll come back and add the last things that later on. Now we are going to break down two whole \nlobsters. So we've got these frozen whole lobsters from The Big Prawn Company, this is a really great \nWaitrose product. It's frozen and cooked already so you just take it out of the freezer 24 hours \nbefore you want to use it. The first thing to do is just twist off those big claws and they'll \njust come away pretty nicely because they're cooked already. You can do the same with the legs \nas well just to give yourself a bit of space. The place that you want to put your knife into, so \nthere's a slight horizontal line there at the top of the lobster's head, get the point of your knife \nright on that cross and then firmly push down and cut between the eyes, straight down like that. \nWe're going to turn that round and we're going to do exactly the same movement the other way. Make \nsure the tail was nice and straight as well, flat against the board and then just push that \nknife down and now you've split the lobster in half. Behind the lobster's head, there's \nlike a kind of little natural sack there, I like to use a teaspoon to just kind of get \nin behind that and just scoop all of that out, okay you don't want that stuff there, okay that's \nthe bit you need to get rid of there. The next bit we need to get rid of is we need to get out the \ndigestive tract. You might see it really nice and easy to grab from the very top there, you \ncan just use the point of your blade to just fish out a little bit of it and then hopefully \nwhen you grab it, you can pull the rest out. Everything else in that lobster is really \nedible and delicious. First thing I like to do is get get the tail meat out, that's the sort \nof majority of the lobster meat. I just kind of go in between the meat and the shell and just prise \nit away and you can see how easily it scoops out and you might be seeing this kind of red \nstuff here and thinking what is that, should I be eating that and it's actually roe. \nThe roe is delicious and it makes a really nice color in the sauce, whether you want to \nuse it or not it's completely up to you. What you also might find is this kind of green \nstuff, okay it doesn't look very attractive, this is called the tomalley, it's the kind of offal of \nthe lobster or like what the brown crab meat is, it's just so full of flavour it'd be such a shame \nto lose. So the next step is I'm going to deal with the claws of this lobster, so one thing \nthat I like to do is just actually break these down into three pieces first. So again twisting \nto break them apart, just pull the claw apart and then that should bring out like this kind of \nfeathery sort of blade part. If you kind of break that away from the bottom part of the claw, \nif you just give it a pinch, if it's cooked it should come out nice and easily like that. If \nyou're struggling to get in there use a skewer or a cocktail stick okay, that's really the best way \nit's a very very thin piece of meat. With the big side of the claw we are going to need to crack \nthis to get into it. I'm going to hold the claw firmly against the board and I'm going to use the \nback of the heavy knife and give it a nice firm tap. So that's one side done, I'm going to turn \nit round and do exactly the same as the other side and then if I then crack the shell like that \nhopefully the lobster meat stays intact. Okay it's really nice if you can get the whole \nclaw meat out like, that you know that's a nice presentation piece. Now for these little knuckle \nparts you do kind of have access to the meat from either side, you might be able to just \nfish it out like this. If it's a bit tricky, just give it a nice firm tap and then you \nshould be able to just fish that meat out. When you've got all the bits of shell out of the \nway on the board, any kind of leftover juice like this it's all good stuff actually, there's a lot \nof flavour in there and we're going to repeat just the exact same process for the second lobster. \nI've got a lovely amount of meat and tomalley there and the claw meat and everything like \nthat. The last thing I need to do before I cook this lobster is to just break down those tails \ninto like these lovely little bite-sized pieces. Now this is the exciting time where we bring all \nof these elements together. I've got my pan on a nice warm heat and what I'm going to be going in \nthere with is my last tablespoon of butter. I've got it nice and foaming as you can see, now I'm \ngoing to go in there with all that lobster meat. Everything's going in and I'm going to just swirl \nthat together just get it nicely heated through. While that's just sizzling through nicely, \nI'm just going to get my last few tarragon stalks so we're going to get a nice little kind \nof fresher burst of it for the end of the dish. Now I'm getting that pan nice \nand warm before I add the brandy so this is one of the most fundamental \nflavors in a thermidor sauce for me, if it doesn't have that lovely brandy in \nthe background, it's not a thermidor sauce. I've got a little blow torch here, if you've \ngot a gas flame you can just give it a tilt and the idea here is we want to cook off all \nof that alcohol. So you don't need to flambe the brandy, it will cook away on its own. There \nwill still be a little bit of alcohol left in the sauce but it's much much reduced compared to how \nit started off. I've just allowed that lobster to cool for a few minutes and now it's safe to add \nto this thermidor sauce. You can see the colour of the roe like in the sauce now, so we've got \nthe English mustard that made a nice bright yellow earlier, now the roe in there giving it a \nbeautiful richness. Just check it for seasoning, add a little bit of salt and pepper if needed. \nI'm just going to use the spoon to pick up these lobster chunks and fill up these lobster shells on \nmy tray here. I've got to make sure this is even because you're just going to cause arguments and \npeople will check as well! Just when we thought they couldn't get any better we've still got our \n50 grams of gruyere to use. Gruyere's a lovely, lovely cheese and it melts really nicely as well. \nThe thing i'm really looking for is some beautiful browning over the top, everything's cooked in \nthere, it's all nice and warm we're just going to make sure it's piping hot and then it comes \nstraight out of the grill beautifully browned. It smells just as good as it looks, that \nis really sumptuous, really extravagant. Imagine just serving that with you know \nfries, salad, nice crisp green salad. I always like to dip my chips in the leftover \nsauce as well. If you could bottle that stuff, you'd be a millionaire. There you have it guys, \nlobster thermidor. Quite a few steps involved but nothing is more worth it I don't think \n- what a perfect way to finish the year!"}

{"kyJbHBJ87Xc": "Today, I'm gonna turn this supermarket-bought fish into something that tastes like it \ncame from a professional restaurant. If you're planning to enjoy sashimi or \nsushi at home, make sure to try this out! So, let's get started. Here’s what I have prepared today. And later \non, I will also use some saltwater ice. Now, let’s sprinkle some salt on this salmon. Why do i do this?\nFirst, let me tell you why. Most of the fish sold at supermarkets \nare usually frozen and then thawed. As a result, the fish retains a lot of moisture, and if you eat it like this, \nit can taste bland and watery. By sprinkling the salt, the excess \nmoisture is drawn out through osmosis. This tightens the flesh and \nconcentrates the flavor, while also removing some of the fishy smell. This process is called 'Shio-jime' in \nJapan, which means tightening with salt. Let's actually do it. The amount of salt I’ll use this \ntime is 1.5% of the fish’s weight. This is what the head chef \nof 'Sushi Hiroya' said that. It's important to sprinkle the salt as evenly as possible. Professional chefs \ndon’t even measure the salt; they just know the right amount \nby eye. That’s craftsmanship! After sprinkling the salt, let the fish \nsit for about 20-30 minutes to dehydrate. If it’s winter, you can leave it \nat room temperature, but in summer, it’s better to keep it in the fridge. Look at that! You can see the excess \nmoisture that’s been drawn out. And you can also see the moisture being \ndrawn out from the surface of the salmon Next, I will wash this \nsalmon with 1% saltwater ice. Did you think washing it with saltwater \nwould make it salty? Don’t worry! What’s important here is to never use \nfresh water. If you use fresh water, it will rapidly strip away both the \nsalt and the flavor from the fish, so be careful!\nOnce it's been rinsed, dry it off with some paper towel. Now Look at this! there’s no more excess \nmoisture and the flesh is firm It’s clear just by looking at it \ncompared to before I salted it! Now, if you leave it in the fridge for \nanother 30 minutes, it will taste even better. Even if you don’t finish it all \ntoday, it’ll keep for 2-3 days. Alright, let’s make some \nsashimi or sushi and try it! And Let's eat!! Itadakimasu!! First, Sashimi\nIt’s not salty at all, there’s almost no fishy smell, and it tastes amazing!!\nIt's as delicious as the salmon I get at a restaurant.\nSushi is also good! It’s really simple, so \ndefinitely give it a try at home!"}
{"bZTI9VGQKNw": "now the first step to great eggplant problem is to find the perfect eggplant take this one for example it has a nice green cap it's not brown and withered the skin okay the skin is firm and taut there's no wrinkles the flesh is firm but with a little bit of give okay you should be able to push in a little bit on that flesh and it should bounce right on back that's when you know that plant's ripe it's not old it's ready to roll also pay no mind to the dimple on the bottom of the eggplant no matter what you read eggplants are genderless there's no male and female eggplant they're all the same okay it's also a fruit bet you didn't know that all right let's cut this thing up i'm going to cut the cap off the top here and then i'm going to take a little off the bottom i'm going to stand it up and slice it lengthwise into pieces that are about i don't know let's see about a quarter inch thick see maybe a little less than that all right one more yeah that one's a little thin you might not use that one anyways that looks pretty good okay i'm gonna put my eggplant aside and let's go ahead and set up our breading station all right let's be honest here there's nothing you can really do to keep your eggplant palm crispy but you can definitely keep it from getting soggy that's why i only use two things when breading the eggplant i use seasoned flour and i use eggs i totally omit the breadcrumbs i think that's what can make the eggplant parm mushy in texture and honestly pretty unpleasant not my thing so i'm going to go ahead and add about a cup of all-purpose flour here a few pinches of fine sea salt just like that a little bit of cracked black pepper nice just a quick stir to incorporate all the ingredients just like that now we're going to crack some eggs i'm going to use three here there we go give it a quick whisk make sure the yolks and the whites are totally homogenous here all right that looks pretty good all right before you go any further you need to have a really tasty sauce on hand kind of like this one right here okay the sauce is ridiculously easy to make let me just take a sec to walk you through it add a little bit of extra virgin olive oil to a sauce pot sweat some finely diced yellow onion and minced garlic until they're soft and tender you're going to want to do this over medium low to medium heat then add some great quality canned tomatoes i'm using a variety that's already crushed up with lots of basil mixed into it if you don't have basil in your tomatoes already make sure you add it to the sauce add some salt to season the sauce then give everything a quick stir place a lid on the pot and let everything chill out for like 20 to 30 minutes you're going to want to do this over low heat so that sauce is barely at a simmer that's pretty much it now back to the eggplant parm i've got this eggplant laid out here and i'm seasoning it with a little bit of salt make sure you get both sides just a little bit i'm going to take a piece of this eggplant i'm going to dip it in the flour here just to get a light coating kind of a dusting on it like that then into the egg wash even coating here using a fork to keep my hands clean let the excess drip off and then right in to the hot oil i think a couple minutes per side is sufficient and then just lay them out on a wire rack to cool off until you finish you know frying the rest of the slices a lot of recipes call for you to salt and then press the eggplant okay that was great back in the day to take some of the bitterness out of the fruit but nowadays garden variety eggplants like this right here stuff that you buy at the store the bitterness has been bred right out of it so there's really no need to uh to do that step anymore okay all right last two slices man everything looks fantastic on to the next step here we go in this bowl i've got some sliced up semi-dry whole milk motts okay you can use the fresh stuff but i really think it's a little too wet for this type of application do what you want though this is not a baking dish recipe what you want to do is alternate layers of the fried eggplant and the mozzarella cheese just like this okay to form your parmesan so pretty much one eggplant that's gonna give you two eggplant parmesans okay so i've used four pieces one two three four and i have four left for a second parmesan all right this looks marvelous i'm just gonna bake these guys in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes until all that mozzarella cheese is nice and melted inside then we'll hit it with some sauce and some parm give it a taste all right i want to show you guys the interior the layers before i top it with sauce okay what do you think you can't say that doesn't look good right okay let's plate it up all right the sauce is piping hot all right you want it that way right over the top just like that i like a little extra okay put as much as you want on there give the plate a teeny shake just kind of spread the sauce out a little bit just like that then you go on with parmesan despite what you might think this dish does not get its name from the cheese itself i'll leave a few links in the description box you guys can read about the origins of eggplant parmesan and uh it's pretty interesting there we go it's a pretty easy one here maybe a little black pepper go and just maybe a little pop of salt there okay let's give it a taste oh my god this looks so good look at how stringy the cheese is look at that oh my god it's so delicious here we go moment of truth it's just it really is hard to beat this version is from a local restaurant one of the most popular ones in town this eggplant apartment is legendary around here okay so this recipe is definitely worth your time hope you give it a try i'll catch you next time i bet you guys thought i forgot about the flame guard contest well i didn't who's gonna win this beautiful piece of equipment huh i've got the names of everybody that commented correctly on that video you had to mention craftsman house and tell me your biggest pizza fail and draw a name there can only be one winner and that person is art savo art you

{"lbNf8bi0zSE": "[Music] hi everyone welcome back today we're making dumpling wrappers this is what i usually use for pot stickers but you can use them for a variety of dumplings first you'll need all-purpose flour or plain flour then you'll mix that flour with very warm water that's almost too hot to touch you want the water to be somewhere between 110 to 120 degrees fahrenheit the warm water helps to relax the dough so that the dough is a lot easier to roll at later i typically don't use boiling hot water because it'll be more difficult to handle when i'm mixing the dough by hand later on also i think the boiling hot water relaxes the dough too much stir the water and flour together until all the water is absorbed into the flour then use your hands to gather up the dough together i like to dig into the dough with my fingers in a claw like motion to work the dry flour into the lump of dough occasionally i'll also brush the dough against the sides of the bowl to catch some of the flour that's stuck on there too take the dough out of the bowl and knead it for two to three minutes i don't usually dust the surface with flour but if your dough is feeling a bit sticky feel free to sprinkle some flour on the work surface there's quite a bit of dough stuck to my fingers so i'm just cleaning off those tiny bits of dough and then working them into the large ball of dough that i'm shaping by the way you can knead all the dough inside a stand mixer too just add all the ingredients to your sand mixer then using a dough hook mix all the ingredients on medium-low for about 3 minutes after a few minutes of kneading the surface of the dough won't look completely smooth and that's ok the important thing is that it shouldn't stick to your hand if it does sprinkle one or two tablespoons of flour on the dough and knead everything again place the dough back into the bowl and cover it with a damp towel or any lid and let the dough rest you can start working with the dough after it rests for about 20 minutes but it's even better if you can let it rest for longer i usually let it rest for at least 45 minutes after resting the dough knead it a few times then use your fingers to make a hole in the center of the dough and stretch out that hole until you get a very large ring the dough should be about one to one and a half inches thick using a sharp knife cut the dough into small pieces for medium sized dumplings aim for dough pieces of about 12 to 14 grams which is about one tablespoon for larger dumplings you'll want them to be about 14 to 16 grams roll out the pieces of dough into tiny balls i like to work the pieces of dough like you see here so that there are practically no visible seams on the exterior of the dough once it's rolled into a ball i think the wrappers roll out in a more consistent circular shape this way but it can also just be me being overly obsessive which is very likely you can simply roll out the pieces of dough into smaller balls with the palms of your hand but as you can see those seams really bother me for some reason now dust the work surface with some flour and cover the small balls of dough with the flour in terms of rolling pins i like using smaller ones that are about 10 to 11 inches because they're easier for the rolling technique that i'm about to show you can use a larger rolling pin but they work better with the two-handed rolling technique that i'll show later on take a piece of dough and flatten it into a disk when you first roll out the wrapper you want to roll the dough out almost all the way before retracting the rolling pin turn the dough 90 degrees and do the same after about one revolution roll out the dough only halfway before rotating it if the dough is sticking to the pin brush it with some flour notice how i never lift the rolling pin it is a constant forward and back motion after a few more revolutions i'll go in and only roll out the edges so that they're thinner i usually place the rolled out wrappers onto a baking sheet that's dusted with flour and cover everything with a dry linen this helps to keep the wrappers from drying out here's another angle of me rolling out the wrappers when i'm pushing the rolling pin away from me that's when i'm exerting the most pressure on the wrapper again notice how i never lift the rolling pin from the surface by the way if you're making dumplings on your own it's better to roll out about four or five wrappers at a time the edges crust over pretty easily which make the dumplings more difficult to seal and plate later on here's how i would roll out the wrappers if i'm using a larger rolling pin in this case you will want to lift the rolling pin from the surface before you turn the wrapper now if you don't master the one-handed rolling technique right away don't worry it took me a long time and even mama lynn hasn't quite gotten the hang of it yet [Laughter] [Laughter] [Applause] the wrappers are now ready to use for making dumplings i don't like rolling out the wrappers a day ahead because they don't feel as nice as freshly made wrappers but if you were to roll them out ahead make sure to brush a lot of starch between the wrappers don't use the same flour that you used for the dough because it'll get absorbed into the dough causing the wrappers to stick together make sure the wrappers are well coated with some type of starch like potato starch or tapioca starch then use saran wrap to cover the wrappers tightly so that they don't dry out i put everything in another container as an extra precaution try to use the wrappers in the next day or two you'll need to use water to moisten the edges so that the wrappers can seal properly alright that's it for this dumpling wrapper tutorial you can get the full recipe on my website which i link to below and if you have any questions feel free to leave it in the comments don't forget to hit subscribe for more videos"}
{"IAJuRClMLKU": "This step is one of the most crucial steps in the whole process. Come on. You know what? What else you want? You take a fry, take a steak. I've been eating this for like 2 years. I'm not sick of it. My name is Sam Braverman. We're here at Lorie Jane and we're going to make you our most popular dish, steak fruits, with our Lori Jane Aqua sauce. >> [music] >> People come here for our steak frees because it is one of the best versions of the dish that exists. On a slower day, we're going to do about 40 or 50 steaks. On an average day, that number is going to float between 80 and 120. To this dish, there are four main components. That's going to be our USDA prime steak, French fries or fruits, which we make here. There's the steak butter that's cooked down from the steak trim with a bunch of lovely herbs and stuff. And then there's our take on an aqua sauce. Step one of steaks. Get some steak, cut it up. This is USDA prime chuck flap. The chuck flap is analogous to a boneless short rib, meaning there's going to be a lot of marbling, a good amount of fat, as well as like some intramuscular and sineuous fat. What we're doing here is trying to just get down to that nice even meaty chunk and then portion you out some lovely 5 oz steaks. Little guys like this. That's going to go towards the staff. Also, we run specials with our excess trim. All the trim that you see JC pulling off of here, that's all going to form the basis of our steak butter. We're minimizing our waste. We're reinforcing the flavors and layering the flavors. It's just how we do things at Lorie Jane. So, the steak butter is going to be our final uh basting product for the steak once it's finishing up on the flat top. Step two, make the steak butter. We're going to take our trim, some thyme, some rosemary, and then a ton of butter. Cook with unsalted butter. You can always add salt, dog. It's harder to take it away. Steak butter, I'm not going to say it's an original concept. It's just another way to not waste a product. We take the steak butter. We go over here. And now that's going to rock for at least an hour to two hours. Last step for the steak butter. Little closer to the end. We're going to add in our garlic. We don't want that garlic to burn, so that's coming right at the end and just infusing a nice garlicky burst into that. Everybody likes herb garlic butter on steak. This is that with more steak in it. Step three, make the fries. With steak fruits, there's two core components to that dish. Steak and French fries. For our French fries, for our fruits, uh we like to use Idaho rusted potatoes. We try to get 70count potatoes. That means there is 70 to a box. So these days, [music] on an average day, we're doing 150 to 200 lb of potatoes. First thing we have to do is rinse the potatoes [music] right over here. I have a few I already did that for. And then these guys will go over here into our potato punch. We punch them at 1/4 in thickness. That's kind of like your classic McDonald's shoestring, fat shoing, batonet, whatever you'd like to call it. Imagine doing this like 250 times. [music] That's what we're looking at just to get the fries to that next stage in the process. When they're coming out, that's that's what a French fry looks like. You know, they're good. What you guys see here is equivalent to let's say 5 to eight portions of steak free fry once they're uh parred off and come up to temp. So, of our total yield for an average night, this is about 1 1/2 to 2%. And now it's time to get them soaking in our sidulated water. We want to take some kosher salt, add that into some cool water, going for about uh 2 tablespoons per 50 lbs of potato. Then, we're also going to add in just some white vinegar, about the same amount. This step, soaking the fries in water, is one of the most crucial steps in the whole process. It's going to help regulate the starch content in the potato. Draw out excess starch we don't want. Keep in the good starch we do want. If you skip this, you will not yield as good of a final product. If [music] you do not blanch, rest your fries, soak them in the water. The end product is going to be floppy. It's going to be slightly brown and discolored. There's totally delicious fries made like that. Like Five Guys, you know, or In-N-Out. They're punched and [music] immediately dropped into the water. And that's why so many people complain about In-N-Out fries. They're like, \"They're limp. They don't have the crust.\" It's because they're skipping that integral step and they're not double frying them. So, now we want to top these off with more water. If we don't cover the potatoes fully with water, they will start to oxidize and brown. We don't want that. We want nice evenly colored potatoes. We're going to let these soak for at least an hour. And while we're doing that, we're going to get working on the AP sauce. Step four, make the sauce. To get that going, we have to break down a bunch of shallots. To make a batch of arlav, it takes roughly a gallon of shallots. I believe that works out to like I want to say 10 lb. [music] If you have a cast iron at home or if you're in a commercial kitchen working with a griddle, you take this guy and follow me over here. Can throw that on the griddle and that's going to help season the griddle so that whatever you're cooking next has a really good release, gets a nice sear. You don't have to be worried about sticking, rust, any of these things. The reason why we use shallots as opposed to, you know, say white or uh red onion or something like that, the shallots have a more nuance, delicate flavor. It kind of ends up being somewhere between like a sweet onion and some garlic. It kind of makes space for all the other things that go in this sauce. Take your rondo or wide bottom saucepan. And then you're going to take your shallots over here. We're going to load them in couple at a time to the Robocu. Pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse. Then once they're getting down, then we're going to take our shallot. We're going to put them all into this pan. If you are at home and you cook food, get a rubber spatula. You can do so many things with it. It's freaking great. And at this point, if you have a little variation in the size of the shallots, that's okay because at the end of the process, we're actually going to strain all these out. You're not going to even eat [music] these shallots. We're just going to infuse the sauce with all their flavor. This is a sauce with a bunch of components and processes, and that helps with layering the flavors throughout. So that when you get that finished bite, you know, you're going to get peppercorn at the front, then some creamy, then like a little bit of that alium vibe, like all of that rocking together [music] to create this like luscious, happy, never broken sauce. So this is our steak butter. Pour a nice generous amount on there. And then we do also add in a smidge of extra virgin olive oil just to help that cooking process go along. It's time to start cooking them. So at this point, the shallots are going to start roasting gently in the pan. We are going to be stirring them throughout. We're just kind of trying to like sweat them now and get them down to a nice translucent period where they'll uh start to release more of that aroma. And then we're going to start adding more stuff and building the sauce on top of that. So, our shallots are just about there. They've been roasting for about 30 35 minutes. We're going to go in with a really generous scoop of garlic that we're mincing here. And then, believe this, we're going to do it again. It's awesome. Who doesn't love garlic? We're starting to get some darker bits. So, before this goes any further, we want to start adding our other liquids, which are going to help this all come together and pull any fond off the bottom of the pan that we want for our final product. It's time for the booze and the other stuff. This is doo cognac. Thank you, French. You're going for very, very generous 2 to 3 oz. We'll put the cognac in there. We'll let it rock for a moment. And then while that's starting to bring everything else together, we're going to take about a quart of white wine, uh, like a nice svenon blanc, a chardonnet, you know, that kind of classic food rule of 10% better than your cheap wine will do. Here, we don't need to cook out all of the alcohol right now, but if you see now when we scrape the bottom of the pan, all of that flavor from the shallots starting to caramelize and even stick a bit, that's going into our sauce. Now in here we have our other flavorants. This is tamari fish sauce. This is kat manis. That's going to be a [music] sweet thickened soy sauce. Uh and we also have some lemon juice and cherry vinegar. Now we have all these guys in here. And you're going to see this color start to take on a more, you know, darker deep brown just shy of black hue. And that's where we want to be at this point in the process because remember we're about to start adding a ton of cream and that's going to lighten the whole thing up a lot. This is one of our final processes. We're going to take our housemade chicken stock and we're going to dump a whole bunch of it in. And we're going to let this reduce. Uh this is about six lers of stock. We want to bring this down to about four to five. And then we'll add our cream in. The sauce is pretty much done. We're just going to let this rock together until that cream comes to a boil. Once the cream is at a boil, we'll then cut the heat. Add a little bit more of our hard herbs. And then we just strain this out and it's ready for service. Step five, put it all together. Make sure you seasoned it. We're going to take our steaks, very generously season them. All right, then we're going to come over here, get our beef tallow. That's going to help us form that crust. Now, we're going to take these guys. You don't hear that sound? It is not hot enough. We want to let these rock for about 3 minutes or so to form that real hard crust on there. We do cook medium rare, sometimes a little closer to rare because it's damn good meat and we want you to have that. While those are hanging out, I'm going to get our peppercorn blend ready, toast those off, and start working on that. What we have here are some green Sichuan peppercorns, standard black pepperc corn, and then we have the red Sichuan peppercorn. So, we take all our peppercorns, give them a nice gentle toast, right, until they start to become fragrant. Once the peppercorns are done toasting, these will get blended up and generously added to the aqua sauce, and that will form the true aqua. Our steak should be just about ready to flip. And it's at this point that we're going to start hitting them with that steak butter. So, by doing this, we're going to start to break down any of that excess intramuscular fat, and we're just infusing this with a lovely beefy, buttery, herby, garlicky flavor. We're going to pop a dome on there. We're going to let that rock for about a minute or so. So, those steaks cook for about 7 or 8 minutes. You have to rest those for at least 7 to 8 minutes. If you're at home and you have the time, rest them for like 12 minutes. It will only be better. All right, it's time to plate up. Check it out. We're going to take our fries and load that boat up. We want to have a nice even bed for your steak to sit on. Take our steak. Pan them out right there. Pan them out. Beautiful. Tiny bit of molden. It's already a very salty dish. take our sauce. So whether that's a whisk or a ladle, should see all the peppercorns in the sauce, you should know that you are getting a peppercorn sauce. A rain a rain of chives. Shower them in chives. This is our most ordered dish. It's served with chopsticks. I am a Jewish kid from New York City. I love Chinese food. Also, this is the best way to eat it. All right. Like watch. We're going to go over here. We're going to pick out our favorite piece of steak. And because we're feeling crazy, we're going to double up. We're going to go for [music] two bites of steak. Everything's okay. I've been eating this for like 2 years. I'm not sick of it. I'm bringing one home. I'm bringing two home. I'm feeding all you guys. It's good. Enjoy I'm going to have lunch."}
{"cO5vpBWjNsk": "Sumo wrestlers eat enormous amounts of food, but the core of their diet isn't junk. It's one simple pot they rely on every single day. [music] It's called chonab. I'm Dan Martin, chef, nutritionist, and half Japanese. And today, I'll show you the version I make at home, share a bit of the culture behind it, and explain why this one pot meal works so well, not just in a sum, but in a normal healthy way of eating, too. Let's make it. Start by getting the broth going. Add water to a large pot with a strip of comoo and bring it up to a gentle boil. If you don't have comoo, a light chicken or vegetable stock works just fine. Once it's infused, remove the comoo and move on to the protein. One thing that's really synonymous with cho nab is meatballs. Traditionally, chanko is a chicken-based dish and there's a bit of symbolism behind that. Chicken stay upright on two feet, which in sumo is considered good fortune. If you end up on all fours in the ring, the match is over. Today, I'm taking in a pescatarian direction. I don't eat a huge amount of chicken and chanko is incredibly flexible. Anyway, every sumo stable in Japan has its own version. Besides, the only wrestling match I'm in these days is with my three-year-old son, and I think I've got another year or two before he starts winning. So, I'm using prawns as the base. They stay tender in the broth and soak up flavor beautifully. Let the broth settle into a gentle simmer. Use two spoons to shape small meatballs and drop them straight into the pot. When they float, they're cooked. Lift them out. Set them aside. We'll add them back in later. Now, season the broth. Add a little mirin, soy sauce, and some minced garlic. Then let the broth come back to a gentle simmer. In go the sturdier vegetables, things like carrots and the root end of the cabbage. I'll also add the shiakea mushrooms here so they can release their dashy into the broth. Once those have softened a bit, the prawn meatballs go back in along with the softer vegetables. I'm adding cod and some shellfish here because they're in season and they're in my fridge. That flexibility is part of Chanka. There's no strict recipe. Chanko started in Sumo Stables as a practical solution. One pot that could be cooked once, eaten together, and scaled up easily. It was designed to give a wrestler everything they needed nutritionally without overthinking it. And this is really why this dish works so well. At its core, it's built around complete nutrition. You've got plenty of protein to support recovery and training, loads of vegetables bring in fiber and volume, a broth that keeps everything hydrated and easy to digest, and just enough fat for flavor and satisfaction while also helping absorb fats soluble vitamins. On its own, this pot is surprisingly light for how much food you're eating, but still deeply nourishing. In sumo culture, the calories really add up because this is eaten with multiple large bowls of rice and sometimes beer on the side. That's how it becomes a very high energy meal. But the structure of the meal itself is really balanced, grounding, and easy to repeat day after day. And that's exactly what we do in my household. If you want to cook this for yourself, I've put together a printable guide in the description with this pescatarian version, a traditional chicken version, and a fully vegetarian one, too. Now, back to the pot. Turn the heat off and add the silk and tofu and finish with miso. Adding it off heat keeps the flavor bright. Then I add a small knob of butter and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. In the traditional chicken version, fat naturally renders into the broth. This does the same job here, rounding everything out and carrying all the flavor. Now ladle up. I'm having mine with a small bowl of rice and barley on the side. Leftovers are great with udon. That's dinner sorted. And if you want to build the rest of your day the same balanced way, I've got a Japanese breakfast video right here. I'll see you there."}

{"m5Kn9WmOCrw": "- Hey, I'm John Kanell. And today on Preppy Kitchen. We're making Shakshuka. So let's get started. First off, we have a little\nbit of chopping to do so grab one big onion or\none and a half small ones and just get that skin off\nand give it a good dice. Shakshuka is a delicious, cozy dish that you can have for breakfast, you can have it for lunch or dinner. This comes from North Africa\nand the name Shakshuka, which I love saying, roughly translates to\nlike mixed it up or mixed. It's because you have all\nthese delicious ingredients is mixed together in a pan. And it is like the easiest\nhearty meal you can make anytime. Shakshuka has thousands of\nvariations all over the world. Like, I think almost\neverybody loves this dish. And, they've made it their\nown with different spices different peppers, different additions. And, you can make this at home with so many different ingredients. You don't have to use\nwhat I'm showing you here. You could add your favorite things. And, if there's something that you think that really needs to be in Shakshuka, let me know in the comments. For example, I love a little\nbit more spice in this dish but because I have the\nkids and Brian at home we're sticking with a bell pepper today. You can use like any peppers that you love and make it as spicy as you want. I'm getting four cloves of garlic, a smash, then we're gonna mince them up. This releases that\npapery skin, and it also gives all those oils a chance\nto get out. Extra flavor. When we went over the ingredients I didn't show you any bread, but like, this is the dish that you want to have, like some nice crusty,\nlike bread or pita with. Just like, soak up all\nthat tomatoey goodness. I'm almost done with my prep. I want to talk about the\npan for just a second. Get a large one out. Could be stainless. Oh, it could be cast iron. Either one will work. If you're using cast iron, just make sure it's well seasoned. And, most of you are gonna make this and enjoy it right away. You don't wanna let the acidic tomatoes sit in cast iron for too long. It'll like, start messing with your season and also leak some stuff out. With that being said for the pans, it's time to get our oil nice and hot. Pan over medium heat. About three tablespoons\nof olive oil or so. Little extra olive oil never hurt anybody. All right. While that's\ngetting nice and hot I wanna see that oil\nshimmering in the light. That's how you know it's ready. We're gonna chop up our bell pepper. And like I said earlier,\nif you like things spicy, go ahead and like, you can\nadd into your jalapeno, like whatever you want. My four-year-old boys are\nnot that into the spice. So, they're good sports\nand they'll give it a try but they'll think it's too\nhot for me, it's too spicy. I was like, okay. Thank you for trying. Get those ribs out. We do not want the seeds. It's always a good idea\nto cut skin-side up. If you do it the opposite way, I swear, unless your knife is very sharp or freshly sharpened, it's\ngonna stick together. So. Skin side up. My oil is dancing in the pan. It's time to add our onions in. You want your onions to be nice and translucent. So just keep mixing them up occasionally. Not burnt, not charred, just mellow and delicious. I'm also gonna add the bell pepper in right now. This will intensify the flavor as it cooks and really soften it up. I like the textures in\nthis to be really soft and we have it with that crisp bread. Oh, it's so good. This can cook for about 10 to 12 minutes or until everything is nice and soft. The onions are translucent. Maybe just starting to take on some color. You can stir this occasionally. It's not a constant\nhovering over situation. So go ahead, have a cup of coffee and just stir once in a while. While this is cooking, I'm just gonna open up my can of tomatoes. Today, I'm using whole peeled tomatoes but you could definitely\nuse crushed tomatoes, the fire roasted, really\nlike, almost anything works. One thing I will do\nwith the whole tomatoes is pour off just a\nlittle bit of the liquid. I don't need that much. Your Shakshuka has to\nhave a certain consistency that's a bit thicker. It shouldn't be like\nvery watery because like, what are you gonna do with that? Like, watery tomato juice? You want full flavors. A lot of the liquids\nin to get reduced off. If you wanna make your\nown version of this, go ahead and raid the fridge, see what veggies you have available. Like, just give them a smaller chop and put them in with the bell pepper so they're nice and tender. I swear almost anything will work. And it's really up to you. Like, what do you wanna add to this. Make it your own dish. This is just like a\ntemplate for you to follow but you can go in any number variations. Right now, you can see my onions are starting to become translucent. They're taking on a little bit of color and we're almost there. I do want them to be just a bit more so. So take a look here and\nsee once it's at this stage you're getting close. Now, it's time for spices. One teaspoon of Paprika. A teaspoon Chili powder. Two teaspoons of Ground Cumin. Let's mix this up right now. It smells so good. I'm also gonna add the garlic in. Now, it's time for the garlic\nand some serious stirring, so it doesn't burn. It's gonna be over heat\nfor about two minutes with just the garlic\nand the spices in there. And just like I said about the vegetables, this is the same deal for the spices. You can add any of the\nspices that you love in here. It'll just bring more flavor. So some other spices you could enjoy here, like Ras El Hanout, like the list goes on. Let me know in the comments,\nwhat you would add. I'm adding my tomatoes now and you see, their whole tomatoes. So we're just gonna use our\nwooden spoon to break it up. But they're gonna also\nbreak down with the heat. Now, I can add some more\nof my tomato juice in here. I just wanted to have control. Sometimes you open up a can of tomatoes and it's a lot of liquid in there. So it's better just to add it in as you want for your consistency. Tomatoes are broken up. Hope they get back together. And this isn't gonna come to a boil. Right now, just the edge is bubbling, but the center is not close. So leave it over medium heat. Once it comes to a boil, then\nwe're gonna reduce to a simmer until we get like a thicker\nor just delicious consistency. Once we get to the right consistency, you'll see why we actually\nneed that consistency in order to cook the eggs properly. This can't just smell good. It has to taste good. So I'm gonna add in half a teaspoon of salt and\nhalf a teaspoon of pepper. I'm using Kosher salt which has like larger\ngrains than fine table salt. So, if you see in my palm, there are like big\npieces of salt over here. If you're using table salt,\nI would add in a quarter and then up it to taste. Freshly cracked black pepper. I'm reducing it to a simmer and this can just bubble away for like 15 to 20 minutes or\nuntil it's noticeably thicker. The cook time really helps the flavors melt and make delicious things happen. My mixture's really reduced. It smells amazing. And right now, I actually want to give it a quick taste just to see if\nthe salt and pepper is right. Oh my gosh. It's really good. Okay. Good handful of your\nCilantro, Parsley, whatever. And I'm saving a little bit for the top. Now, it's time for the eggs. This dish is so delicious\nbecause it has like our veggies but it has protein from the eggs. That's really one of the\nreasons you can enjoy it any time of the day and\nit's just like delicious. I have my wooden spoon. I have a little bowl, you\ncould use ceramic in too. I'm gonna crack an egg into the bowl. Now, create a well, it's like a little\ndepression in the sauce, with the back of your spoon, and slide your egg in there. You don't want your egg to go all over the place. It should be pretty contained. And as you go along, you\ncan kind of just make a little wall to hold it\nin and cover it a bit. It'll help it cook. Repeat that process\nfor the remaining eggs. If you wanted to add like\nless eggs, that's fine too. If you wanna add more, you might be able to fit in one more egg. My eggs are baking already but here's the deal, you\nwant a soft, runny yolk. My favorite thing. And a firm egg white or almost firm. So go ahead and cover it up. This will take about 10 to 12 minutes but everyone's burners\nare a bit different. So go ahead and give it\na check after 10 minutes and then we'll baby it from there. So this is a very important note. I'm actually on propane here at the house and it is hot. If you're using electric, oh my gosh, you're gonna take a little bit longer. Gas, less time. Propane, it's done. So, these eggs are actually perfect after just like four minutes or so. It's really fast. You can see here, the whites are set. And the yolks, I'm not\ngonna burst them yet but the yolks are still nice and runny. So, much less time. It's all ready to go. We're gonna take this off heat. So I'm finishing this off with a sprinkle of Cilantro. You could use Parsley. And a little bit of Feta, just crumbled over gives\nyou some creaminess and extra flavor. Scoop it up, plate it and\nget that crusty bread ready. Oh my gosh. Let's take a bite. Whether you're having this for\nbreakfast, lunch or dinner, this might just be the perfect meal. I hope you get a chance\nto make this recipe. And if you like this video,\ncheck out my breakfast playlist."}
